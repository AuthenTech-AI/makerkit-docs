This kit is the latest version of the Next.js Supabase SaaS Kit, which is a Next.js starter kit for building SaaS applications with Supabase.

## A Modular, Extensible and Modern SaaS Starter Kit

The biggest change in this kit is the modular structure. This allows us to:

- plug new features easily into the kit with no (or minimal) changes to the existing codebase.
- maintain the kit more easily.
- better separate the "core" features from your custom features.
- add additional modules (billing, CMS, monitoring, logger, mailer, etc.) to the kit.

And more!

## A word on this documentation's scope

TLDR: this documentation is about the kit, not the underlying technologies. Building a SaaS application requires a lot of moving parts - so please refer to the official documentation of the underlying technologies for more information.

This documentation teaches you how to configure, run and deploy the kit. This documentation does not replace the documentation of the underlying technologies (Next.js, Supabase, Turbo, etc.). Instead, it focuses on the specific configuration and usage of the kit.

If you need help with Next.js, Supabase, Turbo, etc., please refer to their respective documentation. We will provide links to the official documentation where necessary. Reading the official documentation is crucial to understand the underlying technologies - and that's not part of this documentation.

For anything strictly related to the kit, you can refer to this documentation.
