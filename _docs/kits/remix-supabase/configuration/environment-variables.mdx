## Environment Variables

Makerkit provides templates for configuring your environment variables correctly and the **minimum** environment variables to run your local environment.

To push your project to production, **you must fill these variables by creating your Supabase project** and adding the required values.

Below are the required environment variables for your project to run locally and in production.

```
DEFAULT_LOCALE=en
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# set the below to "production" in your production environment
ENVIRONMENT=development

# SUPABASE
SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# EMAIL
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SENDER='MakerKit Team <info@makerkit.dev>'
```

### Production Environment Variables

<Alert type='warn'>
  When you go to production, ensure you add the required environment variables using your CI or service provider.
</Alert>

Remix **does not bundle your ".env" variables when building your application in production mode**, so you need to ensure you are providing these variables using your CU or service provider.
