There are several ways to fetch the signed in user, depending on the use-case.

## Fetching the signed in user from the backend

To do so, use the function `requireSession`, which also takes care of redirecting the user to the login page if they are not signed in, and checking the correct MFA access level if the user opted in.

You can use this function in:
- API Routes
- Server Actions
- Server Components

### Using "requireSession" in API Routes

When using API routes, you can retrieve the signed in user using the `requireSession` function.

```tsx
import getSupabaseServerClient from '~/core/supabase/server-client';
import requireSession from '~/lib/user/require-session.server';

export async function POST() {
  const client = getSupabaseServerClient();
  const session = await requireSession(client);
}
```

### Using "requireSession" in Loaders

When using Remix Loaders, you can retrieve the signed in user using the `requireSession` function.

```tsx
import { LaaderFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node';

import getSupabaseServerClient from '~/core/supabase/server-client';
import requireSession from '~/lib/user/require-session.server';

export async function loader(args: LaaderFunctionArgs) {
  const client = getSupabaseServerClient();
  const session = await requireSession(client);

  // use session here
}
```

### Using "requireSession" Actions

You can use the `requireSession` function in Remix Actions to retrieve the signed in user.

```tsx
import { ActionFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node';

export async function action(args: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const client = getSupabaseServerClient(args.request);
  const session = await requireSession(client);

  // use session here
}
```

## Fetching the signed in user from the frontend

When in the scope of the `_app` layout, the app automatically injects the user session in the context layout.

This includes the user ID, email, and other authentication data, as well as the user's Supabase DB record.

### Getting the user Session with "useUserSession"

To retrieve the signed in user from the frontend, you can use the `useUserSession` hook:

```tsx
import useUserSession from '~/core/hooks/use-user-session';

const userSession = useUserSession();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.

### Getting the user ID with "useUserId"

To retrieve the signed in user ID from the frontend, you can use the `useUserId` hook:

```tsx
import useUserId from '~/core/hooks/use-user-id';

const userId = useUserId();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.

### Getting the user role within the organization with "useUserRole"

To retrieve the signed in user role of the current organization from the frontend, you can use the `useUserRole` hook:

```tsx
import useCurrentUserRole from '~/core/hooks/use-current-user-role';

const role = useCurrentUserRole();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.
