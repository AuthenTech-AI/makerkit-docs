The starter project comes with two different environment variables files:
1. **.env**: the main environment file
2. **.env.test**: this environment file is loaded when running the Cypress
E2E tests. You would rarely need to use this.

NB: the `.env` file is never committed to the repository. This is because it
contains sensitive information, such as API keys. Instead, we use a `.env.
template` file to show what the `.env` file should look like.

The environment variables for the Remix Supabase kit look like the below:

```bash
DEFAULT_LOCALE=en
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# set the below to "production" in your production environment
ENVIRONMENT=development

# SUPABASE
SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# EMAIL
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SENDER='MakerKit Team <info@makerkit.dev>'
```

    Define your environment variables in your hosting provider
  </Alert.Heading>

  Remix does not use .env files for bundling your app in production. Therefore, you will need to define your environment
  variables in your hosting provider (such as Vercel).

### Define your environment variables in your hosting provider

**NB**: Remix will not bundle environment variables when building your app, but only during development mode. This needs to be repeated, as it is often confused with how Next.js works.

Instead, you will need to define them in your hosting provider (such as your Vercel project settings).
