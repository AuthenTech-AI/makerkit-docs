The starter project comes with two different environment variables files:
1. **.env**: the main environment file
2. **.env.test**: this environment file is loaded when running the Cypress
E2E tests. You would rarely need to use this.

NB: the `.env` file is never committed to the repository. This is because it
contains sensitive information, such as API keys. Instead, we use a `.env.
template` file to show what the `.env` file should look like.

The environment variables in your project will look like the below:

```bash
DEFAULT_LOCALE=en
EMULATOR=true
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=false

# FIREBASE
GCLOUD_PROJECT=demo-makerkit
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo-makerkit
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=demo-makerkit.appspot.com
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=localhost
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL=
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Change this with your project's APP ID
FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:981813564016:web:f13148231721fcd0ee5ab5
# Change this with your project's API KEY
FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAAqU_euGAMtJoXp0sECblAIndifCp0pmE

# FIREBASE EMULATOR

# SERCET KEY TO SIGN SECRETS. REPLACE THE BELOW WITH A RANDOM AND COMPLEX STRING. KEEPT IT SAFE.
SECRET_KEY=123456789

# STRIPE

# APPCHECK
APPCHECK_KEY=
APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=
```

### Define your environment variables in your hosting provider

**NB**: Remix will not bundle environment variables when building your app, but only during development mode.

Instead, you will need to define them in your hosting provider (such as your Vercel project settings).
