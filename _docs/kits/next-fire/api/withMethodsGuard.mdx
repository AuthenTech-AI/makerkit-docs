---

The `withMethodsGuard` function is used to guard API endpoints by HTTP methods. For example, in the example below, we only allow `GET` and `POST` requests to the `/api/hello-world` endpoint.

```ts {13}
import { NextApiRequest,NextApiResponse } from "next";

import { withAuthedUser } from '~/core/middleware/with-authed-user';
import { withPipe } from '~/core/middleware/with-pipe';
import { withMethodsGuard } from '~/core/middleware/with-methods-guard';
import { withExceptionFilter } from '~/core/middleware/with-exception-filter';

export default function helloWorld(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const handler = withPipe(
    withMethodsGuard(['GET', 'POST']),
    withAuthedUser,
    (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World!' });
    }
  );

  return withExceptionFilter(req, res)(handler);
}
```
