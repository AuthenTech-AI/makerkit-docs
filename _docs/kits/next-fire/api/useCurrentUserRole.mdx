---

In case you need to access the current user role **within the current organization**, you can use the `useCurrentUserRole` hook.

To use this hook, simply import it from the `~/lib/organizations/hooks/use-current-user-role` module, and then call it from your component.

Here's an example:

```tsx
import { useCurrentUserRole } from '~/lib/organizations/hooks/use-current-user-role';

function MyComponent() {
  const role = useCurrentUserRole();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current user role: {role}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

n this example, the useCurrentUserRole hook is used to retrieve the current user's role within their current organization.

Overall, the `useCurrentUserRole` hook is a convenient and easy-to-use way to retrieve the role of the current user within their current organization in your Next.js app.
