There are several ways to fetch the current selected organization, depending on the use-case.

## Fetching the selected Organization from the backend

You will use this function fairly often for fetching the current organization from the backend.

```tsx
import { NextApiRequest,NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { getCurrentOrganization } from '~/lib/server/organizations/get-current-organization';
import { withPipe } from '~/core/middleware/with-pipe';
import { withAuthedUser } from '~/core/middleware/with-authed-user';

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const user = req.firebaseUser;
  const organization = await getCurrentOrganization(user.uid);
  // ...
}

export default withPipe(withAuthedUser, handler);
```

## Fetching the selected Organization from the frontend

The `withAppProps` middleware used in the gated app pages makes sure that the current organization is passed from the backend to the frontend.

### Getting the Organization with "useCurrentOrganization"

To retrieve the signed in user from the frontend, you can use the `useUserSession` hook:

```tsx
import { useCurrentOrganization } from '~/lib/organizations/hooks/use-current-organization';

const organization = useCurrentOrganization();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.

### Getting if the Organization subscription status is set to "active" on the frontend

You can use the `useIsSubscriptionActive` hook to get the subscription status of the current organization. You may want to use this function to gate access to certain parts of the app.

```tsx
const isActive = useIsSubscriptionActive();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.
