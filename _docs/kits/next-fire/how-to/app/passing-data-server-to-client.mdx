Passing data from the server to a client during SSR is a common task.

In Makerkit, you can use the following pattern to pass data from the server to the client.

1. We use `withAppProps` to initialize the data on the server and making the required checks.
2. We augment the `props` property returned by `withAppProps` with the data we want to pass to the client.

```tsx
import { GetServerSidePropsContext } from "next";
import { withAppProps } from '~/lib/props/with-app-props';

type Data = {
  // ...
}

function Page({ data }: { data: Data }) {
  // you can use the data here
}

export async function getServerSideProps(
  ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext
) {
  const { props } = await withAppProps(ctx);

  // We augment the props with the data we want
  // to pass to the client
  // replace the below with your own logic
  const data = await getDataFromServer();

  return {
    props: {
      ...props,
      data,
    }
  };
}
```

As you can see - we augment the `props` property returned by `withAppProps` with the data we want to pass to the client.

The property `data` will then be available in the `props` property of the page component `Page`.

```tsx
type Data = {
  // ...
}

interface PageParams {
  data: Data
}

function Page({ data }: { data: Data }) {
  // you can use the data here
}

export default Page;
```
