your MakerKit application'

Makerkit provides a component and a route to sign your users in using an Email Link.

Thanks to Email Links Authentication, users can enter their email and then sign in by clicking on the link they received to their email.

<Alert type='warn'>
  Remember, when using this authentication method in production, ensure you manually activate it from the Firebase Console first.
</Alert>

Navigate to the `configuration.ts` file, and let's switch the
`email/password` method with `email link`:

```tsx title="configuration.ts"
{
  auth: {
    providers: {
      emailPassword: false, // we switch this to false
      phoneNumber: false,
      emailLink: true, // we switch this to true
      oAuth: [GoogleAuthProvider, FacebookAuthProvider],
    },
  }
}
```

That's it! The result should be similar to the image below:

Ok, cool, **but can you use both?**

Yes, of course! With that said, you may need to tweak the
UI so that the result will look nice.
