on the organization's subscription"

Makerkit provides some utilities to retrieve the current organization's
subscription: you can use these utilities to allow or gate access to
specific features, pages, or to perform certain actions.

1. On the client side, we can use the hook `useIsSubscriptionActive`
2. On the server-side, we can use the functions
`isOrganizationSubscriptionActive` and `getOrganizationSubscription`

## Client Side Gating

Let's assume we want to allow only users who belong to paying organizations to
perform a certain action:

```tsx title="src/lib/organizations/permissions.ts"
function isAdmin(
  role: MembershipRole
) {
  return role === MembershipRole.Admin;
}
```

Now, combine this function with other conditions:

```tsx title="src/lib/organizations/permissions.ts"
export function useCreateNewThing(
  userRole: MembershipRole,
) {
  const isPayingUser = useIsSubscriptionActive();

  return isPayingUser && isAdmin(userRole);
}
```

As you may know, I recommend adding all the permissions logic to the file
`permissions.ts` (or similar files), and never inline it: this makes it easy to
store logic in one single place rather than scattered across the
application. 

Inlining logic in our code will make it hard to track logic
down and debugging it.

Once defined out logic functions in `permissions.ts`, we can then use these
in our components to hide the sections that users do
not have access to:

```tsx
function Feature() {
  const userRole = useCurrentUserRole();
  const canCreateThing = useCreateNewThing(userRole);

  if (!canCreateThing) {
    return <div>Sorry, you do not have access to this feature. Subscribe?</div>
  }

  return <FeatureContainer />;
}
```

### Firestore Rules

Another essential thing to take into account is securing our Firestore
rules using the organization's subscription.

For example, let's assume your application requires organizations to be
paying customers to write to a certain collection:

```js
function getOrganizationSubscription() {
  let organization = getOrganization(organizationId);

  return organization.subscription;
}

function isPayingOrganization(subscription) {
  return subscription != null && (subscription.status == 'paid' || subscription.status == 'trialing');
}

function isProPlan(subscription) {
  let organization = getOrganization(organizationId);

  return subscription.stripePriceId == 'pro-plan-id';
}

function canWriteToCollection(organizationId) {
  let subscription = getOrganizationSubscription();

  return isPayingOrganization(subscription) && isProPlan(subscription);
}

match /organizations/{organizationId} {
  match /tasks/{task} {
    allow create: canWriteToCollection(organizationId);
    allow list: if userIsMemberByOrganizationId(organizationId);
  }
}
```

## Server Side Gating

When gating access on the server side, we can use two utilities that allow
us to get the organization's subscription by its ID.

### Using Firestore utilities

When you need to check the user's subscription in your API functions, you can
use the functions `isOrganizationSubscriptionActive` and
`getOrganizationSubscription` exported from
`src/lib/server/organizations/memberships.ts`.

For example, let's assume we have an API handler that performs an action:

```tsx
export default function async apiHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const organization = req.cookies.organization;

  const isSubscriptionActive =
    await isOrganizationSubscriptionActive(organization);

  if (!isSubscriptionActive) {
    return throwForbiddenError();
  }

  // all good! perform action
}
```

### Gating access to pages server-side

For example, let's assume we want to gate access to a page if the
`organization` is not on a paid plan. To do so, we can add some logic to
`getServerSideProps`:

```tsx
import { withAppProps } from './with-app-props';
import { Stripe } from "stripe";

function GatedPage() {
  return <div>...</div>;
}

export default GatedPage;

export async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  const appProps = await withAppProps(ctx);

  // something wrong happened, user gets redirected either way
  if ('redirect' in appProps) {
    return appProps;
  }

  // get organization from subscription
  const subscription = appProps.props.organization?.subscription;

  // check the subscription exists and status is "active" or "trialing"
  if (!subscription || !isSubscriptionActive(subscription.status)) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/dashboard?error=forbidden-subscription',
      },
    };
  }

  // all good, we can simply return the props
  return appProps;
}

function isSubscriptionActive(status: Stripe.Subscription.Status) {
  return ['active', 'trialing'].includes(status);
}
```

Of course, in this case, you could extend `with-app-props` and make the
above reusable for all the routes that require organizations to have
additional permissions.
