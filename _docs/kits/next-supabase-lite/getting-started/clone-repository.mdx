If you have bought a license for MakerKit, you have access to all the
repositories built by the MakerKit team. In this document, we will learn how
to fetch and install the codebase.

### Requirements

To get started with the Next.js and Supabase SaaS template, we need to ensure
you install the required software.

- Node.js
- Git
- Docker

### Getting Started with MakerKit

#### Clone the repository

To get the codebase on your local machine using the original repository, clone the repository with the
following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-lite.git my-saas
```

The command above clones the repository in the folder `my-saas` which
you can rename it with the name of your project.

#### Initializing Git

Now, run the following commands for:

1. Moving into the folder
2. Add the remote repository

```
cd my-saas
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin <your-git-repository>
```

If you haven't created a Git repository yet, you can do it later on.

### Setting the Upstream repository, and fetching updates

Now, we can add the original Makerkit repository as "upstream" so we can fetch updates from the main repository:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-lite.git
```

To fetch updates, you can run the following command:

```
git pull upstream main
```

Sometimes, you'll likely run into conflicts when running this command, so carefully choose the changes (sorry!).

If you want to use the Lemon Squeezy branch, you'll need to switch to the `main-ls` branch:

```
git checkout main-ls
```

Of course, when pulling updates, you'll need to pull from the `main-ls` branch:

```
git pull upstream main-ls
```

### Installing the Node dependencies

Finally, we can install the NodeJS dependencies with `npm`:

```
npm i
```

While the application code is fully working, we now need to set up your Supabase
project.

So let's jump on to the next step!
