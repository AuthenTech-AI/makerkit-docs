The Super Admin was released in the version 0.2.0.

It allows your administrators to manage your users and organizations - such as:

1. Viewing the app's users and their details
2. Viewing the app's organizations
3. Viewing an organization's members
4. Banning or Disabling users
5. Impersonating users

## Accessing the Super Admin

To access the super admin, you need to navigate to the path `/admin`. If you're using the emulator, you can do so using the `test@makerkit.dev` account, which is set to having a super admin role.

You can also find the link in the profile dropdown of users with admin privileges.

To find out how to set admin permissions to your production users, please continue reading the next post.

## Viewing Users

The Users page allows you to manage your users. You can view all your users paginated and search for a specific user. You can also ban, reactivate and impersonate users.

You can view the detail of a user by clicking on the user's ID, where you can see the user's email, name, organizations, and other information.

#### Disabling/Banning users

Admins can easily disable/ban some users from the users page or from the user's page:
