To add a new page to the marketing site of your Next.js project, you can create a new page in the `src/app/(site)` directory.

By "marketing site", we mean the public pages of your project, such as the homepage, the about page, the contact page, etc.

<div>
  <Alert type={'warn'}>
    <div>
      Use the below code only for public pages accessible by everyone, such as the homepage, the about page, the contact
      page, etc.
    </div>
  </Alert>
</div>

### Adding a new page to the marketing site

As you know already, we can add pages to our Next.js App Router application by creating files within the `src/app` directory named as `page.tsx`.

For example, if you want to add a page at `/about`, you can create a new file at `src/app/(site)/about/page.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx title="src/app/(site)/about/page.tsx"
function AboutPage() {
  return <div>About page</div>;
}

export default AboutPage;
```

This page will **automatically inherit the site layout** from `src/app/(site)/layout.tsx` - which means it will already display the header and footer.

#### I don't want to use the same layout though?

If you don't want to use the site layout, create a route group inside `src/app`, and add your page there.

### Adding a new page to the marketing site with translations

If you have translations on your marketing site - to ensure the page is translated correctly server-side, we use the `withI18n` HOC:

```tsx title="src/app/(site)/about/page.tsx"
import { withI18n } from '~/i18n/with-i18n';

function AboutPage() {
  return <div>About page</div>;
}

export default withI18n(AboutPage);
```
