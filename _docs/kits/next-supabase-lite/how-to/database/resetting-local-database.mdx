Resetting the DB can be useful when updating the schema of your database using the SQL schema files instead of the Supabase Studio UI.

To reflect the new changes, and/or resetting the database to the local seed, run the following command:

```
npm run supabase:db:reset
```

The database is now in the same state as when you started your Supabase server.

**Important**: users created during the session will be reset, which means your application may be in a conflicting state. Log out or delete the cookies to restart from scratch.
