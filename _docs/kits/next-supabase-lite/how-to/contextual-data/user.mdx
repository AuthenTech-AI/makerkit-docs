There are several ways to fetch the signed in user, depending on the use-case.

## Fetching the signed in user from the backend

To do so, use the function `requireSession`, which also takes care of redirecting the user to the login page if they are not signed in, and checking the correct MFA access level if the user opted in.

You can use this function in:
- API Routes
- Server Actions
- Server Components

### Using "requireSession" in API Routes

When using API routes, you can retrieve the signed in user using the `requireSession` function.

```tsx
import getSupabaseRouteHandlerClient from '~/core/supabase/route-handler-client';
import requireSession from '~/lib/user/require-session';

export async function POST() {
  const client = getSupabaseRouteHandlerClient();
  const session = await requireSession(client);
}
```

### Using "requireSession" in Server Actions

When using server actions, you can retrieve the signed in user using the `requireSession` function.

```tsx
'use server';

import getSupabaseServerActionClient from '~/core/supabase/server-action-client';
import requireSession from '~/lib/user/require-session';

export async function yourServerAction() {
  const client = getSupabaseServerActionClient();
  const session = await requireSession(client);

  // use session here
}
```

### Using "requireSession" in Server Components

You can use the `requireSession` function in Server Components as well.

```tsx
async function PageComponent() {
  const client = getSupabaseServerComponentClient();
  const session = await requireSession(client);

  // use session here
}
```

## Fetching the signed in user from the frontend

When in the scope of the `app/(app)` layout, the app automatically injects the user session in the context layout.

This includes the user ID, email, and other authentication data, as well as the user's Supabase DB record.

### Getting the user Session with "useUserSession"

To retrieve the signed in user from the frontend, you can use the `useUserSession` hook:

```tsx
import useUserSession from '~/core/hooks/use-user-session';

const userSession = useUserSession();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.

### Getting the user ID with "useUserId"

To retrieve the signed in user ID from the frontend, you can use the `useUserId` hook:

```tsx
import useUserId from '~/core/hooks/use-user-id';

const userId = useUserId();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.
