This documentation contains information about the Makerkit UI components Reference API. The Makerkit UI components Reference API is a collection of React components that can be used to build Makerkit UI components.

The large part of the Makerkit UI components Reference API is based on the [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library. This library is itself based on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

The components listed here are available in all the Makerkit SaaS Kits, and the differences should be minimal. With that said, you may still encounter some differences in the components' behavior and appearance, or import paths, and default/non-default exports.

This Reference API is a work in progress. We will be adding more components and examples over time.

Currently, the components are separated into the following categories:
- Forms
- Information
- Navigation
- Utility

## Forms

Forms are used to collect user input. They are made up of form elements such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.

### Information

Information components are used to display information to the user. They are made up of elements such as headings, tables, alerts, and more.

### Navigation

Navigation components are used to help users navigate through a website or application. They are made up of elements such as menus, breadcrumbs, tabs, and more.

### Utility

Utility components are used to perform specific tasks. They are made up of elements such structural components, spinners, and more.
