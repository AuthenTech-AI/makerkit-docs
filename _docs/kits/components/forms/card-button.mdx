The Card Button component is a simple styled wrapper around the native HTML button element.

## Basic Usage

By default - the Button component will render a primary button with a solid background color. This is the same as setting the `variant` prop to `primary`.

```tsx
import { CardButton } from '~/core/ui/CardButton';

<CardButton>
  Click Me
</CardButton>
```

<DemoContainer>
  <CardButton>
    Click Me
  </CardButton>
</DemoContainer>
