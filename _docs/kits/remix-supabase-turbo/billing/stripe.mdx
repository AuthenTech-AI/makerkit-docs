Stripe is the default billing provider in both the local config and the DB, so you don't need to set these values if you want to use Stripe.

For Stripe, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
```

While the `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is public and can be added anywhere - **please do not add the secret keys** to the `.env` file.

During development, you can place them in `.env.local` as it's not committed to the repository. In production, you can set them in the environment variables of your hosting provider.

## Stripe CLI

To run the Stripe CLI - which allows you to listen to Stripe events straight to your own localhost - you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run stripe:listen
```

**The first time you set it up, you are required to sign in**. This is a one-time process. Once you sign in, you can use the CLI to listen to Stripe events.

**Please sign in and then re-run the command**. Now, you can listen to Stripe events.

## Configuring the Stripe Customer Portal

Stripe requires you to set up the Customer Portal so that users can manage their billing information, invoices and plan settings from there.

1. Please make sure to enable the setting that lets users switch plans
2. Configure the behavior of the cancellation according to your needs

## Setting Production Webhooks in Stripe

When going to production, you will need to set the webhook URL and the events you want to listen to in Stripe.

The webhook path is `/api/billing/webhook`. If your app is hosted at `https://myapp.com` then you need to enter `https://myapp.com/api/billing/webhook`.

Makerkit needs the following events to work:

1. `checkout.session.completed`
2. `customer.subscription.updated`
3. `customer.subscription.deleted`

Only if you're using one-off payments, please add:

1. `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`
2. `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`

If your application needs more events, please add them, [but remember to handle them](billing-webhooks).

You can [handle additional events](billing-webhooks) by adding the required handlers in the `api/billing/webhook/route.ts` file.
