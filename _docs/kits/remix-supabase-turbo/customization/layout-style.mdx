By default, Makerkit uses the `sidebar` layout style for both the user and the team workspaces.

You can change the layout style by setting the `VITE_USER_NAVIGATION_STYLE` and `VITE_TEAM_NAVIGATION_STYLE` environment variables. The default style is `sidebar`.

To set the layout style to `header`, update the environment variables:

```bash
VITE_TEAM_NAVIGATION_STYLE=header
VITE_USER_NAVIGATION_STYLE=header
```

The default layout style is `sidebar`:

And here is `header` layout:
