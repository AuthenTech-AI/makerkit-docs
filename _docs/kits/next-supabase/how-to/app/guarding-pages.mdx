As a server-side rendered application, Next.js Supabase will always render the page on the server before sending it to the client.

**We assume you are in the context of a specific organization, as it is the primary use case for the Starter Kit.**

We can use the function `loadAppData` to get data required to load the main layout of the app located at `app/dashboard/[organization]`.

NB: you can call `loadAppData` multiple times because it uses caching.

In the following example, we are loading the user role within the organization **that is currently selected**.

```tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

import loadAppData from '~/lib/server/loaders/load-app-data';
import MembershipRole from '~/lib/organizations/types/membership-role';

async function OnlyOwnersPage() {
  const data = await loadAppData();
  const userRole = data.role;

  // if the user is not an owner, redirect them to the home page
  if (userRole !== MembershipRole.Owner) {
    redirect('/');
  }

  // render the page
}
```

As you can see above:
1. We are loading the data required to render the page
2. We are checking the user role within the organization
3. If the user is not an owner, we redirect them to the home page (but feel free to change this)

## Guarding Application Pages with Organization Subscriptions

In this example, we want to make sure the Organization is subscribed to a plan before allowing the user to access the page.

To do so, we check the `subscription` property of the `Organization` object and redirect the user to the dashboard if the subscription is `active` or `trialing`.

```tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import loadAppData from '~/lib/server/loaders/load-app-data';

async function OnlySubscribersPage() {
  const data = await loadAppData();
  const status = data.organization.subscription?.data?.status;

  // if the subscription is not active, redirect the user to the dashboard
  if (!isSubscriptionActive(status)) {
    redirect('/');
  }

  // render the page
}

function isSubscriptionActive(status: string | undefined) {
  return ['trialing', 'active'].includes(status);
}
```
