Makerkit provides some utilities to retrieve the current organization's
subscription: you can use these utilities to allow or gate access to
specific features, pages, or to perform certain actions.

1. On the client side, we can use the hook `useIsSubscriptionActive`
2. On the server-side, we can use the functions
`getOrganizationSubscriptionActive` and `getOrganizationSubscription`

## Client Side Gating

Let's assume we want to allow only users who belong to paying organizations to
perform a certain action:

```tsx title="src/lib/organizations/permissions.ts"
function isAdmin(
  role: MembershipRole
) {
  return role === MembershipRole.Admin;
}
```

Now, combine this function with other conditions:

```tsx title="src/lib/organizations/permissions.ts"
export function useCreateNewThing(
  userRole: MembershipRole,
) {
  const isPayingUser = useIsSubscriptionActive();

  return isPayingUser && isAdmin(userRole);
}
```

As you may know, I recommend adding all the permissions logic to the file
`permissions.ts` (or similar files), and never inline it: this makes it easy to
store logic in one single place rather than scattered across the
application. 

Inlining logic in our code will make it hard to track logic
down and debugging it.

Once defined out logic functions in `permissions.ts`, we can then use these
in our components to hide the sections that users do
not have access to:

```tsx
function Feature() {
  const userRole = useCurrentUserRole();
  const canCreateThing = useCreateNewThing(userRole);

  if (!canCreateThing) {
    return <div>Sorry, you do not have access to this feature. Subscribe?</div>
  }

  return <FeatureContainer />;
}
```

NB: You should also tighten up the security on the server-side using RLS to prevent users from accessing data they should not have access to.

## Server Side Gating

When gating access on the server side, we can use two utilities that allow
us to get the organization's subscription by its ID.

### Gating access to certain pages using Server Components

For example, let's assume we want to gate access to a page if the
`organization` is not on a paid plan: we can prevent the page from rendering by adding some logic to the Server Component rendering the page.

```tsx
import { use } from "react";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import { Stripe } from "stripe";
import loadAppData from '~/lib/server/loaders/load-app-data';

interface Params {
  params: {
    organization: string;
  }
}

function GatedPage({ params }: Params) {
  const canAccessPage = use(canUserAccessPage(params.organization));

  if (!canAccessPage) {
    redirect('/dashboard?error=forbidden-subscription');
  }

  // ...
}

async function canUserAccessPage(
  organizationUid: string
) {
  const data = await loadAppData(organizationUid);
  const subscription = data.organization.subscription?.data;

  return subscription && isSubscriptionActive(subscription.status);
}

function isSubscriptionActive(status: Stripe.Subscription.Status) {
  return ['active', 'trialing'].includes(status);
}

export default GatedPage;
```

If you want to go more granular, you can also check the subscription's price ID to match a specific plan for example.

Of course, if you reuse the logic above very often, you can also extract it to a function and reuse it across your Server Components:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

async function canUserAccessProFeature(
  organizationUid: string
) {
  const data = await loadAppData(organizationUid);
  const subscription = data.organization.subscription?.data;

  return subscription && isSubscriptionActive(subscription.status);
}

function isSubscriptionActive(status: Stripe.Subscription.Status) {
  return ['active', 'trialing'].includes(status);
}

export async function withSubscriptionGuard(organizationUid: string) {
  const canAccessPage = await canUserAccessProFeature(organizationUid);

  if (!canAccessPage) {
    redirect('/dashboard?error=forbidden-subscription');
  }
}
```

And reuse it in your Server Components:

```tsx
interface Params {
  params: {
    organization: string;
  }
}

async function GatedPage({ params }: Params) {
  await withSubscriptionGuard(params.organization);

  // ...
}

export default GatedPage;
```
