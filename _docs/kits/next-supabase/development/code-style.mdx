The Makerkit's boilerplate codebase is formatted with *Prettier*. You can configure it as you wish by updating the file Prettier configuration in the `package.json` file:

The default settings look like the below:

```json
{
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true,
  "arrowParens": "always",
  "parser": "typescript",
  "printWidth": 80,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

For example, to remove semicolons, update the `semi` and set it to `false`.

After adjusting the Prettier configuration, you can reformat the whole project by running the following command:

```
npm run format
```
