To run the project, follow these steps to start the development server, Supabase, and Stripe (optional for billing system testing).

## 1. Start the Development Server

To start the web application development server, run:

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

This command launches the web application.

For more details about the web application, please refer to `apps/web/README.md`.

### Quick Start Credentials

Use the following credentials to get started right away:

- **Email**: `test@makerkit.dev`
- **Password**: `testingpassword`

To confirm email addresses, visit [Inbucket](http://localhost:54324/status). Supabase uses Inbucket to capture emails sent during the authentication process.

## 2. Start Supabase

Ensure Docker is running, then start Supabase with:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:start
```

This command initiates the Supabase web server.

## 3. Start Stripe (Optional)

To test the billing system, start Stripe by running:

```bash
pnpm run stripe:listen
```

This command routes webhooks to your local machine.

You now have the Next.js Supabase Turbo project running on your local machine. ðŸš€

## Deploying to Production

When you're ready to deploy the project to production, follow the [checklist](checklist) to ensure everything is set up correctly.

**Note:** Using Supabase's hosted instance is similar to deploying to production. Therefore, you still need to follow the checklist to ensure everything is properly configured.
