To run the project - there are some commands you need to run.

1. Start the development server (web application)
2. Start Supabase (ensure Docker is running)
3. Start Stripe (optional, if you want to test the billing system)

## 1. Start the development server

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

This command will run the web application.

Please refer to `apps/web/README.md` for more information about the web application.

To get started right away, use the credentials below:

- **Email**: `test@makerkit.dev`
- **Password**: `testingpassword`

To confirm email addresses, please visit [Inbucket](http://localhost:54324/status): Supabase uses Inbucket to capture emails sent during the authentication process.

## 2. Start Supabase

Run the following command to start Supabase (or use your IDE to run the command in the package.json)

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:start
```

This command will start the Supabase web server.

## 3. Start Stripe

If you want to test the billing system, you can start Stripe by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm run stripe:listen
```

This will route webhooks to your local machine.

You now have the Next.js Supabase Turbo project running on your local machine. ðŸš€

## Deploying to Production

When you are ready to deploy the project to production, please follow the [checklist](checklist) to ensure everything is set up correctly.

NB: using Supabase's hosted instance is akin to deploying to production - which means that you'd still need to follow the checklist to ensure everything is set up correctly.
