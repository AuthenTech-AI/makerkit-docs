To update the codebase, you will pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository and merge them into your project. This will ensure that you have the latest features and bug fixes.
ðŸš€ Ready to keep your project at the cutting edge?

This guide will walk you through the process of updating your codebase by pulling the latest changes from the GitHub repository and merging them into your project. This ensures you're always equipped with the latest features and bug fixes.

If you have followed the instructions in the previous sections, you should have a Git repository set up for your project, with an `upstream` remote pointing to the original repository.
If you've been following along with our previous guides, you should already have a Git repository set up for your project, with an `upstream` remote pointing to the original repository.

To update your project, you will first fetch the latest changes from the `upstream` remote, and then merge them into your project.
Updating your project involves fetching the latest changes from the `upstream` remote and merging them into your project. Let's dive into the steps!

Here are the steps to update your project.
## 0. Stashing your changes

### Update the `upstream` remote
If you have uncommited changes, before updating your project, it's a good idea to stash your changes to avoid any conflicts during the update process. You can stash your changes by running:

First, you need to fetch the latest changes from the `upstream` remote. To do this, run the following command:
```bash
git stash
```

This will save your changes temporarily, allowing you to update your project without any conflicts. Once you've updated your project, you can apply your changes back by running:

```bash
git stash pop
```

If you don't have any changes to stash, you can skip this step and proceed with the update process. ðŸ›…

Alternatively, you can commit your changes.

## 1. Refresh the `upstream` remote

The first step is to fetch the latest changes from the `upstream` remote. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

Please run `pnpm i` in case there are any changes in the dependencies.
When prompted the first time, please opt for merging instead of rebasing.

### Resolve any conflicts
Don't forget to run `pnpm i` in case there are any updates in the dependencies. ðŸ”„

If there are any conflicts during the merge, you will need to resolve them manually. Git will show you the files with conflicts, and you can edit them to resolve the conflicts.
## 2. Resolve any conflicts

#### Conflicts in the lock file
Encountered conflicts during the merge? No worries! You'll need to resolve them manually. Git will highlight the files with conflicts, and you can edit them to resolve the issues.

If you have conflicts in the `yarn.lock` file, accept any of the two changes (don't do it manually), then run:
### 2.1 Conflicts in the lock file "pnpm-lock.yaml"

```
If you find conflicts in the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, accept either of the two changes (avoid manual edits), then run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

The lock file will now reflect both your changes and the changes from the `upstream` repository.
Your lock file will now reflect both your changes and the updates from the `upstream` repository. ðŸŽ‰

#### Conflicts in the DB types
### 2.2 Conflicts in the DB types "database.types.ts"

Since your types will differ from the ones in the `upstream` repository, you need to rebuild them.

To do so, reset the DB:
Your types might differ from those in the `upstream` repository, so you'll need to rebuild them. To do this, reset the DB:

```bash
npm run supabase:web:reset
```

Then, run the following command to regenerate the types:
Next, regenerate the types with the following command:

```bash
npm run supabase:web:typegen
```

Now the types will reflect the changes from the `upstream` repository and your project.
Your types will now reflect the changes from both the `upstream` repository and your project. ðŸš€

### Run a health check on your project after resolving conflicts

After resolving the conflicts, it's time to test your project to ensure everything is working as expected. Run your project locally and navigate through the various features to verify that everything is functioning correctly.

You can run the following commands for a quick health check:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

And lint your code with:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

If everything looks good, you're all set! Your project is now up to date with the latest changes from the `upstream` repository. ðŸŽ‰

## Commit and push changes

Once everything is working fine, don't forget to commit your changes with git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE" and push them to your remote repository with git push origin BRANCH_NAME.

Of course - please make sure to replace COMMIT_MESSAGE and BRANCH_NAME with your actual commit message and branch name. ðŸš€
