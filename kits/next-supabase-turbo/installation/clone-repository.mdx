Clone this repository with the command:
## Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

NB: If your SSH key isn't set - then use the HTTPS.
**Note:** If your SSH key isn't set up, use HTTPS instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

NB: please switch to HTTPS for ALL commands if you are not using SSH, not just the clone command.
### Important: Use HTTPS for All Commands if Not Using SSH

If you are not using SSH, ensure you switch to HTTPS for all Git commands, not just the clone command.

Now, remove the original `origin`:
## Configuring Git Remotes

After cloning the repository, remove the original `origin` remote:

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

Add upstream pointing to this repository so you can pull updates
Add the upstream remote pointing to the original repository to pull updates:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

Once you have your own repository, do the same but use `origin` instead of `upstream`
Once you have your own repository set up, add your repository as the `origin`:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

To pull updates (please do this daily with your morning coffee):
### Keeping Your Repository Up to Date

To pull updates from the upstream repository, run the following command daily (preferably with your morning coffee â˜•):

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

This will keep your repository up to date.
This ensures your repository stays up to date with the latest changes.

### 0.1. Install Pnpm
## 0.1. Install Pnpm

Install Pnpm globally with the following command:

```bash
# Install pnpm
npm i -g pnpm
```

## 1. Setup dependencies
## 1. Setup Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
pnpm i
```

With these steps completed, your development environment will be set up and ready to go! ðŸš€

## 2. Post-merge Hooks

It's very useful to run the following command after pulling updates from the upstream repository:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i
```
```

This ensures that any new dependencies are installed and the project is up to date. We can run this command automatically after pulling updates by setting up a post-merge hook.

Create a new file named `post-merge` in the `.git/hooks` directory:

```bash
touch .git/hooks/post-merge
```

Add the following content to the `post-merge` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pnpm i
```

Make the `post-merge` file executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
```

Now, every time you pull updates from the upstream repository, the `pnpm i` command will run automatically to ensure your project is up to date. This ensures you're always working with the latest changes and dependencies and avoid errors that may arise from outdated dependencies.
