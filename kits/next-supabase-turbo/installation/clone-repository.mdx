## 0. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Docker
- Pnpm
- Supabase account (optional for local development)
- Payment Gateway account (Stripe/Lemon Squeezy)
- Email Service account (optional for local development)

Clone this repository with the command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

NB: If your SSH key isn't set - then use the HTTPS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

NB: please switch to HTTPS for ALL commands if you are not using SSH, not just the clone command.

Now, remove the original `origin`:

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

Add upstream pointing to this repository so you can pull updates

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

Once you have your own repository, do the same but use `origin` instead of `upstream`

To pull updates (please do this daily with your morning coffee):

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

This will keep your repository up to date.

### 0.1. Install Pnpm

```bash
# Install pnpm
npm i -g pnpm
```

## 1. Setup dependencies

# Install dependencies
pnpm i
