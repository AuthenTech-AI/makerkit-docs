## Prerequisites

To get started with Makerkit, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- **Node.js 18.x or later**
- **Docker**
- **Pnpm**
- **Supabase account** (optional for local development)
- **Payment Gateway account** (Stripe or Lemon Squeezy)
- **Email Service account** (optional for local development)

## Verify your Git username

To verify you have access, you need to check that your local Git username is the same as set up in the Makerkit's Github organization.

Please run the following command to check your Git username:

```bash
git config user.username
```

If the output is not your Github username, or does not match the username registered in Makerkit's Github organization, you can set it using the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.username <your-github-username>
```

**NB**: You must replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual Github username in between quotes.

For example, if your Github username is `johndoe`, you can set it using the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.username "johndoe"
```

This is important to ensure you can run the repository.

## Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

**Note:** If your SSH key isn't set up, use HTTPS instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

### Important: Use HTTPS for All Commands if Not Using SSH

If you are not using SSH, ensure you switch to HTTPS for all Git commands, not just the clone command.

## Configuring Git Remotes

After cloning the repository, remove the original `origin` remote:

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

Add the upstream remote pointing to the original repository to pull updates:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

Once you have your own repository set up, add your repository as the `origin`:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

### Keeping Your Repository Up to Date

To pull updates from the upstream repository, run the following command daily (preferably with your morning coffee â˜•):

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

This ensures your repository stays up to date with the latest changes.

## 0.1. Install Pnpm

Install Pnpm globally with the following command:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

## 1. Setup Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
pnpm i
```

With these steps completed, your development environment will be set up and ready to go! ðŸš€

## 2. Post-merge Hooks

It's very useful to run the following command after pulling updates from the upstream repository:

```bash
pnpm i
```

This ensures that any new dependencies are installed and the project is up to date. We can run this command automatically after pulling updates by setting up a post-merge hook.

Create a new file named `post-merge` in the `.git/hooks` directory:

```bash
touch .git/hooks/post-merge
```

Add the following content to the `post-merge` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

pnpm i
```

Make the `post-merge` file executable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
```

Now, every time you pull updates from the upstream repository, the `pnpm i` command will run automatically to ensure your project is up to date. This ensures you're always working with the latest changes and dependencies and avoid errors that may arise from outdated dependencies.
