## Prerequisites

To get started with Makerkit, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- **Node.js 18.x or later**
- **Docker**
- **Pnpm**
- **Supabase account** (optional for local development)
- **Payment Gateway account** (Stripe or Lemon Squeezy)
- **Email Service account** (optional for local development)

## Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

**Note:** If your SSH key isn't set up, use HTTPS instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

### Important: Use HTTPS for All Commands if Not Using SSH

If you are not using SSH, ensure you switch to HTTPS for all Git commands, not just the clone command.

## Configuring Git Remotes

After cloning the repository, remove the original `origin` remote:

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

Add the upstream remote pointing to the original repository to pull updates:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

Once you have your own repository set up, add your repository as the `origin`:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

### Keeping Your Repository Up to Date

To pull updates from the upstream repository, run the following command daily (preferably with your morning coffee â˜•):

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

This ensures your repository stays up to date with the latest changes.

## 0.1. Install Pnpm

Install Pnpm globally with the following command:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

## 1. Setup Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for the project:

```bash
pnpm i
```

With these steps completed, your development environment will be set up and ready to go! ðŸš€
