To run the project, follow these steps to start the development server, Supabase, and Stripe (optional for billing system testing).

## 1. Start Supabase

{% alert type="warning" title="Have Docker running" %}
We need to have Docker running so that we can start the Supabase Docker container. If you don't have Docker running, please start it now.
{% /alert %}

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is the best way to get started with Docker.

Ensure Docker is installed and running, then start Supabase with:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:start
```

This command initiates the local Supabase web server. This allows us to develop locally without having to deploy to Supabase.

When you're ready to deploy the project to production, follow the [checklist](../going-to-production/checklist) to ensure everything is properly configured.

Please read the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started#running-supabase-locally) for more information about starting Supabase locally.

## 2. Start the Development Server

To start the web application development server, run:

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

This command launches the web application.

For more details about the web application, please refer to `apps/web/README.md`.

### Quick Start Credentials

Makerkit seeds the DB with a few users by default. To login as a test user, you can use the following credentials:

- **Email**: `test@makerkit.dev`
- **Password**: `testingpassword`

To confirm email addresses, visit [Inbucket](http://localhost:54324). Supabase uses Inbucket/Mailpit to capture emails sent during the authentication process.

Bookmark the Inbucket/Mailpit URL, as you will need it quite often.

#### Troubleshooting

If you're hitting issues with loading modules (such as `Module not found:
Can't resolve 'react-dom/client'`), you're likely running into Windows-related
issues with Node.js.

Please see the [the Troubleshooting section](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-module-not-found) for more information.

#### Super Admin Credentials

To login as a super admin, you can use the following credentials:

```json
{
  "email": "super-admin@makerkit.dev",
  "password": "testingpassword"
}
```

Since you require MFA for the Super Admin user, please use the following steps to pass MFA:

1. **TOTP**: Use the following [TOTP generator](https://totp.danhersam.com/) to generate a TOTP code.
2. **Secret Key**: Use the test secret key `NHOHJVGPO3R3LKVPRMNIYLCDMBHUM2SE` to generate a TOTP code.
3. **Verify**: Use the TOTP code and the secret key to verify the MFA code.
Make sure the TOTP code is not expired when you verify the MFA code.

## 3. Start Stripe (Optional)

To test the billing system, start Stripe by running:

```bash
pnpm run stripe:listen
```

This command routes webhooks to your local machine.

You now have the Next.js Supabase Turbo project running on your local machine. ðŸš€

## 4. Email Server for local development

To receive emails during local development, Supabase uses [InBucket/Mailpit](http://localhost:54324). It's from here that you will be receving emails from both Supabase Auth and transactional emails during local development.

You can bookmark the InBucket/Mailpit URL, as you will need it quite often.

## Deploying to Production

When you're ready to deploy the project to production, follow the [checklist](../going-to-production/checklist) to ensure everything is set up correctly.

**Note:** Using Supabase's hosted instance is similar to deploying to production. Therefore, you still need to follow the checklist to ensure everything is properly configured.
