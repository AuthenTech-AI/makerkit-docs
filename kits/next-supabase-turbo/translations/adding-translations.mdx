Translations are stored at application level and can be found at `apps/web/public/locales`. Translations for English (which is the only language provided by default) will be found at `apps/web/public/locales/en`.

If you wish to provide a new language, there are two steps.

### 1. Add the language files

Create a new folder using the correct language code at `apps/web/public/locales/[lng]` where `[lng]` can be any correct language code, such as `de`, `it`, `es`, `ja`, etc.

### 2. Update settings

Add the language to the settings file at `apps/web/lib/i18n/i18n.settings.ts`:

```tsx
/**
 * The list of supported languages.
 * By default,  only the default language is supported.
 * Add more languages here if needed.
 */
export const languages: string[] = [defaultLanguage, 'es'];
```

In the above, I appended the language `es` to the `languages` array. You can add as many languages as you need.
