By default, Makerkit uses the `sidebar` layout style for both the user and the team workspaces.

You can change the layout style by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_NAVIGATION_STYLE` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_NAVIGATION_STYLE` environment variables. The default style is `sidebar`.

To set the layout style to `header`, update the environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_NAVIGATION_STYLE=header
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_NAVIGATION_STYLE=header
```

## Sidebar Layout

The default layout style is `sidebar`:

{% img src="/assets/images/docs/turbo-sidebar-layout.webp" width="2522" height="1910" /%}

You can customize the sidebar layout to set it as expanded or collapsed. By default, it is always set to expanded.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOME_SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEAM_SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED=true
```

You can decide the configuration for the each workspace.

### Auto-expanding the Sidebar on Hover

You can set the sidebar to auto-expand on hover by setting the following environment variable:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPAND_SIDEBAR_ON_HOVER=true
```

This is a commonly used pattern in many SaaS apps - such as Supabase, or OpenAI.

## Header Layout

And here is `header` layout:
