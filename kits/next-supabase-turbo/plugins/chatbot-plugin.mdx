This plugin allows you to create a chatbot for your app. Users can interact with the chatbot to get information about
your app.

The chatbot will index your app's content and provide answers to user queries.

## Installation

Install the chatbot plugin from your main app:

```bash
npx @makerkit/cli plugins install chatbot
```

Now, install the plugin from your main app by adding the following to your `package.json` file:

```json title="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@kit/chatbot": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

And then run `pnpm install` to install the plugin.

## Import the Chatbot component

You can now import the Chatbot component in your app:

```tsx
import { Chatbot } from '@kit/chatbot';

<Chatbot sitename={'Makerkit'} />
```

## Create the API route handler

You can add this anywhere since it's configurable, but my suggestion is to add it to the `api/chat` directory. Create a new file called `route.ts` at `apps/web/app/api/chat/route.ts`:

```ts
import { handleChatBotRequest } from '@kit/chatbot/server';

export const POST = handleChatBotRequest;
```

If you use a different path, please set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATBOT_API_URL` environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATBOT_API_URL=/api/some-other-path
```

## Add the Migration file

Copy the migration file at `packages/plugins/chatbot/migrations` into your apps migration directory at `apps/web/supabase/migrations`.

Make sure to reset the database after copying the migration file and make sure to push this to your remote instance.


## Configuration

The Chatbot component accepts the following props:

```tsx
interface ChatBotProps {
    siteName: string;

    conversationId?: string;
    defaultPrompts?: string[];
    isOpen?: boolean;
    isDisabled?: boolean;
    settings?: ChatbotSettings;
    storageKey?: string;

    onClear?: () => void;
    onMessage?: (message: string) => void;
}
```

## Customizing the Chatbot

You can customize the chatbot by providing a `settings` object:

```tsx
type Position = `bottom-left` | `bottom-right`;

interface Branding {
    primaryColor: string;
    accentColor: string;
    textColor: string;
}

export interface ChatbotSettings {
    title: string;
    position: Position;
    branding: Branding;
}
```

For example:

```tsx
<Chatbot
    settings={{
        title: 'Chat with us',
        position: 'bottom-right',
        branding: {
            primaryColor: '#000',
            accentColor: '#000',
            textColor: '#fff',
        },
    }}
/>
```

## Indexing Content

At this time - the Chatbot will crawl your app's content and index it - by reading the sitemap.xml file.

The crawler will infer the sitemap.xml from the website's robots.txt file. Otherwise, you can provide the sitemap.xml
URL using the `CHATBOT_WEBSITE_SITEMAP_URL` environment variable.

```bash
CHATBOT_WEBSITE_SITEMAP_URL=https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

To index your website's content, the chatbot will read the sitemap.xml file.

To launch the chatbot crawler, run the command:

```bash
pnpm --filter chatbot indexer -- --url=<url> --include=<include-paths> --exclude=<excluded-paths>
```

For example:

```bash
pnpm --filter chatbot indexer -- --url=https://example.com --include=/docs,/blog --exclude=/blog/secret
```

The `--url` flag is required and should point to the website's root URL. The `--include` and `--exclude` flags are optional and should be comma-separated paths.

It's highly recommended to include the `--exclude` flag to prevent the chatbot from indexing way too many pages or stuff you don't want to be indexed.

## Environment Variables

You can customize the chatbot model by providing the following environment variables:

```
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo
LLM_BASE_URL=
LLM_API_KEY=
```

The model needs to be compatible with the OpenAI API.
