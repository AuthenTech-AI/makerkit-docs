[Sentry](https://sentry.com) is an observability platform that helps you monitor your application's performance and errors. In this guide, you'll learn how to configure Sentry in your Next.js Supabase SaaS kit.

To use [Sentry](https://sentry.com) to capture exceptions and performance metrics of your app, please define the below variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MONITORING_PROVIDER=sentry
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_dsn
```

Please install the package `@sentry/nextjs` in `apps/web/package.json` as a dependency.

```bash
pnpm i @sentry/nextjs --filter web
```

Finally, update the Next.js configuration in your `next.config.js` file:

```tsx title="next.config.mjs"
import { withSentryConfig } from '@sentry/nextjs';

// wrap your Next.js configuration with the Sentry configuration
withSentryConfig(nextConfig);
```

You can find your Sentry DSN in the Sentry dashboard.
