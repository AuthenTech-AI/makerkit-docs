By default, MakerKit uses a custom hook that wraps the browser's `fetch` to make it easier to use with React's components named `useApiRequest`. 

Additionally, this custom hook automatically adds two headers for security reasons: 
- `X-Firebase-AppCheck` - which is the token generated when using **Firebase AppCheck**
- `x-csrf-token` - the page's CSRF token generated when the page is server-rendered. It's needed to protect the page from CSRF attacks.

Since the `useApiRequest` hook is pretty basic, if you make complex queries to your API, you may want to use a more complete implementation such as `react-query` or `swc`. However, If you don't make complex queries, it can be unnecessary since most of your queries will be to Firestore, which uses its own client-side data-fetching method.

To make these libraries seamlessly work with the API, you only need to consider the headers above if the API uses them to protect your application's endpoints.

### Generating an App Check Token

To generate an App Check token, you can use the `useGetAppCheckToken` hook:

```tsx
const getAppCheckToken = useGetAppCheckToken();
const appCheckToken = await getAppCheckToken();

console.log(appCheckToken) // token
```

You will need to send a header `X-Firebase-AppCheck` with the resolved value returned by the promise `getAppCheckToken()`.

### Sending the CSRF Token

To retrieve the page's CSRF token, you can use the `useGetCsrfToken` hook:

```tsx
const getCsrfToken = useGetCsrfToken();
const csrfToken = getCsrfToken();

console.log(csrfToken) // token
```

You will need to send a header `x-csrf-token` with the value returned by `getCsrfToken()`.
