When storing sensitive data, such as API keys, you must ensure to encrypt your data in Firestore.

To use these utilities, you must provide an environment variable named `SECRET_KEY`. This should be provided safely using your CI since it's a secret key.

MakerKit provides some utilities to encrypt and decrypt your data. 

```tsx
import { encrypt, decrypt } from '~/core/generic/crypto';

// storing secrets
function storeApiKey(key: string) {
  const encryptedKey = encrypt(key);

  return storeKeyInFirestore(encryptedKey);
}

// retrieving secrets
function getApiKey(id: string) {
  const encryptedKey = await getApiKeyFromFirestore(id);

  return decrypt(encryptedKey);
}
```
