Now that we have some components to display, we need to add them to the actual Remix pages.

If you have not created the files in the `Routing` section above, it's time to do it.

#### Using the components AppHeader and AppContainer

These components are used to wrap the content of the pages. They are responsible for displaying the header and the container of the page.
```tsx
function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <AppHeader>
        <span className={'flex space-x-2'}>
          <Squares2X2Icon className="w-6" />

          <span>
            <Trans i18nKey={'common:dashboardTabLabel'} />
          </span>
        </span>
      </AppHeader>

      <AppContainer>
        Your content goes here
      </AppContainer>
    </>
  );
}
```
