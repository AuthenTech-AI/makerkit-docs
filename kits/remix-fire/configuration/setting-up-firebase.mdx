You should be all set if you have already installed NodeJS on your machine. If not, please install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) before continuing.

If any of the following commands do not work, please install the Firebase tools package globally:

```
npm i firebase-tools -g
```

Now, run this command to set up your Firebase project:

```
firebase init
```

Now, select all the products you would like to set up. If you're not sure yet, I recommend the following ones:
- Emulators
- Cloud Firestore
- Cloud Storage
- Remote Config

<Alert type='info'>
You do not need any changes to start developing your application. Feel free
to complete the configuration once you want to deploy the app for the first
time.
</Alert>

By default, Makerkit starts the application with a demo project
`demo-makerkit`.

You can rename the demo name however you want, as long as you keep the
prefix "demo", which tells Firebase not to use any production service and
not to require additional configuration for developing the application. In
fact, you do not need to create a Firebase project to get started!

Additionally, remember to change the project in the environment variables.

**If you also want to create a real Firebase project, please read on.**

#### Create or select a Project

If you have already created a project using the Firebase Console, continue by
using "Use an existing project"; otherwise, you can create one right away by
selecting "Create a new project".

If you're more comfortable creating a new project using the Firebase Console,
 [create a new project from here](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

#### Emulators

The CLI should prompt you to choose the emulators to download and the ports for each. Next, select the emulators you need based on the products selected during the first step.

Otherwise, you don't need to make any changes because this starter already uses the Firebase default ports.

Once completed, you should have the following new files in your project:
- `.firebaserc`
- `firebase.json`
- `firestore.rules`
- `firestore.indexes.json`

## Firebase Project Set-up

If you have created a Firebase project, you should be able to access this
project using the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

We assume you're building a web app: let's create a new web project.

<Video src='/assets/images/docs/create-web-app-firebase.mp4' />

### Copying the Firebase configuration in the environment file

After the previous step, you should be seeing the Firebase configuration
object.

We need to add this to your `.env` file, which will automatically
populate the project configuration file `~/.configuration`.

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
FIREBASE_APP_ID=
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
```

### Getting the service account

You can find the service account by clicking on `Settings->Service Accounts`.
You should copy the text highlighted in the video below:

<Video src='/assets/images/docs/find-service-account.mp4' />

Afterward, you need to populate the relative environment variable:

```
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL=
```

You could safely add it using the file of your staging account. If it's
 your production environment, please add it using the Vercel console instead (or any other service you use to
 deploy the project).

### Generating the Private Key

The private key is fundamental to running your app with Admin permissions on the
server side. From the same page, click on "Generate Private key".

You should see the modal below:

<Image
  width={'1368'}
  height={'1018'}
  src={'/assets/images/docs/generate-private-key.webp'}
  alt={'Generate Firebase Private Key'}
/>

Once you open the generated JSON file, copy the `private_key` property and place it in your CI or your environment file as long as you do not commit the environment file.

The environment variable to populate is `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`:

```
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

The key looks like this:

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
***************************
-----END PRIVATE KEY-------
```

If you enter the wrong key, you will not be able to sign in server-side. In short, it won't work.

<Alert type='warn'>
Do not commit the file if you add the private key to your local environment file
</Alert>

## Firestore

Now it's time to set up Firestore DB. From the main panel on the left-hand side of the Firebase Console, click on `Firestore Database`.

Once you click on the `Create Database` CTA, you will se a modal like in the
image below:

<Image
  width={'1810'}
  height={'1132'}
  src={'/assets/images/docs/create-firestore-db.webp'}
  alt={'Create Firestore DB'}
/>

Don't overthink what to choose: we use the default MakerKit Firestore
rules which use the production configuration by default.

### Location
The next step is to choose the Firestore Database's location.

Which option to choose here depends entirely on **where you think most of
your users come from**.

<Image
  width={'1724'}
  height={'1034'}
  src={'/assets/images/docs/firestore-location.webp'}
  alt={'Choose Firestore Location'}
/>

Be careful to the Firebase notice:

<Alert type='warn'>
After you've set this location, you cannot change it later. Also, this location setting will be the location for your default Cloud Storage bucket.
</Alert>

If you're not sure, think it through. You do not need this step to start
working on your app with the Emulators, so feel free to come back to this
later when you have made a decision.

### Firestore Indexes

If you are setting up Makerkit for the first time, remember to set up an
index for querying an invitation without knowing its organization.

You can do so using the following link (replace
"\[\[YOUR_PROJECT_ID\]\]" with your real project ID):

https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/\[\[YOUR_PROJECT_ID\]\]/firestore/indexes/single-field?create_exemption=ClBwcm9qZWN0cy9zdG9yeWpveS00NmVlMy9kYXRhYmFzZXMvKGRlZ
mF1bHQpL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25Hcm91cHMvaW52aXRlcy9maWVsZHMvY29kZRACGggKBGNvZGUQAQ

## Firestore and Storage Security Rules

Finally, you are required to publish the security rules to the production project. 

You can do so by logging in to the Firebase Console and pasting the rules from the `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` files in their respective sections.

You don't need to do this right away, but you will need to do it before you deploy your application to production.
