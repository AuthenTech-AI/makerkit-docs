<Alert type="info">
  Setting Firebase Functions is optional. You only need to set up Firebase Functions if you need certain features, such as Firestore Triggers, Storage Triggers, Authentication Blocking Functions, etc.
</Alert>


While you may want to use Remix's own API functions for your application's API,
there are many scenarios where you may be required to use Firebase Functions, for example:

1. You want to implement [Authentication Blocking Functions](/blog/tutorials/blocking-authentication-firebase-auth)
2. You need to use Firebase Storage Triggers
3. You need to use Firebase Firestore Triggers

Therefore, it's essential to know how to set up Firebase Functions in a Remix environment, such as the Makerkit SaaS template.

## Initializing Firebase Functions

Assuming you have a working Makerkit project installed, let's type the following command in your terminal:

```
firebase init functions
```

When prompted about creating a new project, choose not to create a default project, as you may have already done it.

After completing the CLI prompts, you should have a few more files in your project:

```
âœ”  Wrote functions/package.json
âœ”  Wrote functions/tsconfig.json
âœ”  Wrote functions/src/index.ts
âœ”  Wrote functions/.gitignore
```

#### Adjust or delete the eslint configuration file

You may need to delete (or adjust) the `eslint` file generated by the CLI, as it may conflict with the one in the root of your project. We recommend using the one in the root of your project shipped with Makerkit.

If you leave it as is, you may see linting errors in your functions code, that can also prevent you from deploying your functions.

### Firebase Functions setup

I usually proceed to copy some of the scripts to the root `package.json`, such as the below:

```
"build:functions": "tsc -P functions/tsconfig.json",
"build:functions:watch": "tsc -P functions/tsconfig.json --watch",
"deploy:functions": "firebase deploy --only functions"
```

1. `build:functions` builds the functions bundle and then exits
2. `build:functions:watch` builds the functions in development mode, so it will re-bundle your code on changes
3. `deploy:functions` deploys your Functions to the Firebase cloud

### Writing your First Function

Let's write our first, very simple Firebase Function:

```tsx
import { https } from 'firebase-functions';

export const helloWorld = https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  res.send({ Hello: `World` })
});
```

### Running the Firebase Functions emulators

When using Makerkit, simply run the emulators:

```
npm run firebase:emulators:start
```

If working correctly you'll see the following output:

```
âœ”  functions: Loaded functions definitions from source: helloWorld.
```

ðŸŽ‰ And now you can finally use the full power of Firebase's Functions!

### Ignore the Firebase Functions folder when deploying to Vercel

Since Firebase Functions are to be deployed to Firebase, you can ignore the `functions` folder when deploying to Vercel.

To do so, create a file named `.vercelignore` in the root of your project and add the following line:

```
functions
```
