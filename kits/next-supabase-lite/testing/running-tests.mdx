The Makerkit SaaS boilerplate comes with a set of predefined tests with the following goals:

1. Verify that the boilerplate application works well
2. Provide instructions for building your own tests

As your application grows, the tests will inevitably need to be updated and
maintained. We hope that our tests will be simple to understand and to
change when you will need them.

## Running the Next.js development server

First, we have to run the following command to run Next.js with a testing
environment (i.e. using `.env.test`):

```
npm run dev:test
```

This command will start a Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000, so
it's important to make sure you have no other Next.js server running at the
same port.

Additionally, we have to start the **Supabase local instance**:

```
npm run supabase:start
```

## Running Cypress in development mode

While you build your tests, it can be handy to use a windowed version of the
Cypress testing suite, so that you can easily retry the tests without having
to re-run the while tests suite.

To do that, run the following command:

```
npm run cypress
```

## Running All Cypress tests

Whenever you want to run all your tests at once, you can use the following commands:

```
npm run cypress:headless
```

This will run all the tests and exit.

## Running Cypress in CI mode

Whenever you want to run all your tests in a CI
environment, you can use the following commands:

```
npm test
```

The command above will:

1. Start the Supabase local instance
2. Start the Next.js environment
3. Run the tests in headless mode
4. Exit and close all the processes

As you may have noticed, this is the command to run in your CI environment.

## Testing Stripe

Testing Stripe requires one more process to start, i.e. the official Stripe
emulator.

The command below **will require Docker installed**, which is why you can
choose to disable it by setting the environment variable `ENABLE_STRIPE_TESTING`
to `false` from the `.env.test` environment file:

```bash title=".env.test"
ENABLE_STRIPE_TESTING=false
```

If instead, you want to test Stripe Checkout as well, run the command below:

```
npm run stripe:mock-server
```

As we've mentioned, this will require Docker running. Of course, we think
it's worth it.
