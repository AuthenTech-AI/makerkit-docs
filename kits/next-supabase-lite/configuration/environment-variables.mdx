The starter project comes with three different environment variables files:

1. **.env**: this is a shared environment file. Here, you can add variables shared across all the environments.
2. **.env.development**: the configuration file loaded when running the `dev` command
 - Use this file for your **development configuration**.
3. **.env.production**: the configuration file loaded when running the `build` command locally or deployed to Vercel.
 - Use this file for your **actual project's configuration** (without private keys!).
4. **.env.test**: this environment file is loaded when running the Cypress E2E tests. You would rarely need to use this.

Additionally, you can add another environment file named `.env.local`: this file is never added to Git and can be used to store the secrets you need during development.

<Alert type='warn'>
  <span className='block'>
    Never ever add secrets to your `.env` files. It's not safe, and you risk leaking confidential data.
  </span>

  <span>
    Instead, add your secrets using your Vercel Console, or use the `.env.local` file during development.
  </span>

## Environment Variables

Makerkit provides templates for configuring your environment variables correctly and the **minimum** environment variables to run your local environment.

To push your project to production, **you must fill these variables by creating your Supabase project** and adding the required values.

The production environment variables set your application up for the Supabase environment:

```
DEFAULT_LOCALE=en
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SUPABASE
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# EMAIL -
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SENDER='MakerKit Team <info@makerkit.dev>'
```

<Alert type="warn">
  <Alert.Heading>
    You must add these variables to your production environment.
  </Alert.Heading>

  <span>
    You can safely add public or non-secret variables to your <code>.env.production</code> file for your production environment. Instead, add your secrets using your Vercel Console, or use the <code>.env.local</code> file during development.
  </span>
</Alert>

#### Use your CI/CD to set environment variables for your production environment

Some of the variables above are secret. You must add these from your CI/CD environment:

```
# SUPABASE
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# EMAIL -
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SENDER='MakerKit Team <info@makerkit.dev>'
```

You can safely add public or non-secret variables to your `.env.production` file for your production environment.
