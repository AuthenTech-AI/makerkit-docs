If you're encountering a 403 error on Server Actions and API Routes, it is possible that your requests lack a CSRF Token.

By default, the Makerkit middleware at `src/middleware.ts` will automatically try to validate a CSRF token for HTTP methods such as `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`: failing to send a valid CSRF token will result in these requests being forbidden.

To fix this error, check out these pages:

1. **Server Actions**: [Add a CSRF token to your Server Actions](server-actions-csrf)
2. **API Routes**: [Add a CSRF token to your API Routes](api-routes)

### The CSRF Token is sent, but it's not defined

If the CSRF Token is being sent but it's null/undefined, it's likely a bug. In that case, please open a support ticket in our Discord channel.
