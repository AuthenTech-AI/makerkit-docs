```

### Build a production bundle

Run the command:

```
npm build
```

### Start a production server

Run the command after building the application with the `build` command:

This is optional as it is automatically called after the `build` command.

```
npm run format
```

npm run typecheck
```

### Linting

Run the command:

```
npm run lint
```

### Start the Supabase Local Environment

Run the command:

```
npm run supabase:start
```

This is needed during development. It requires Docker to be up and running.

### Stopping the Supabase Local Environment

Run the command:

```
npm run supabase:stop
```

### Reset the Supabase Local Environment Database

### Run the Local Stripe Webhooks Server

This is needed if you are testing Stripe. This command requires Docker, but you can alternatively install Stripe on your OS and change the command to use `stripe` directly.

Run the command:

```
npm run stripe:listen
```

### Run the Mock Stripe Server

Run the command:

```
npm run stripe:mock-server
```

### Kill Ports

The following commands kills all the ports that need to be free to run the Makerkit stack. This can be necessary after running the tests, for example when the emulators don't free up the ports after shutting down.

Run the command:

```
npm run killports
```
