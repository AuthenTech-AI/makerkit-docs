MakerKit's data model is voluntarily as simple as possible, with a limited set of assumptions.

MakerKit is not supposed to be a finite product but a solid foundation on which it is quick to get started and build your SaaS product.

To summarize, the Postgres Database model contains the following tables: `users`, `subscriptions` and `users_subscriptions`.

## Users

Users are, of course, foundational to any application.

If a user signed in using Supabase Authentication, it merely means we have
verified their credentials, not that they have an account.

We have to create an additional collection to store a user's data, such as:
- names (first name, last name)
- profile photo
- settings
- any other information which is not possible to update using their Authentication record (email, and sign-in providers)

Below is the `users` table:

```sql
create table users (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  photo_url text,
  display_name text
);
```

## Subscriptions

When users complete the Stripe checkout, the application will store some information from the subscription object sent by Stripe. 

Below is the schema of the information stored in the Database:

```sql
create table subscriptions (
  id text not null primary key,
  price_id text not null,
  status subscription_status not null,
  currency text,
  interval text,
  interval_count int,
  created_at timestamptz,
  period_starts_at timestamptz,
  period_ends_at timestamptz,
  trial_starts_at timestamptz,
  trial_ends_at timestamptz
);
```

To link a `customer_id` from Stripe with an organization, we use a join table `organizations_subscriptions`:

```sql
create table users_subscriptions (
  user_id uuid not null references public.users (id) on delete cascade,
  subscription_id text unique references public.subscriptions (id) on delete set null,
  customer_id text not null unique,
  primary key (user_id)
);
```

We store the `customer_id` property so that, when a user is first linked to a Stripe customer, can access their Stripe data using the Billing Portal.

When a subscription is active, the `subscription_id` field will be populated with the subscription ID. Otherwise, the field will be `null`.

## Storage

By default, the kit also creates one Storage bucket: the user's `avatars`:

```sql
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, PUBLIC)
  values ('avatars', 'avatars', true);
```
