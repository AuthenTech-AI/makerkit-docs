The Makerkit SDK is a simple API for your Makerkit projects. It allows you to easily interact with the Makerkit core entities, such as: Users, Organizations, Subscriptions and Memberships.

As you build your application, you will need to interact with the core entities. The SDK provides a simple way to do that.

  The Makerkit SDK is still unreleased. It is currently in preview and is subject to change. We are working hard to make
  it available as soon as possible.

## Usage

Initializing the SDK is simple. You will need to provide any of the Supabase Server clients - depending on where you are using the SDK (route, server component or server action).

### Loaders/Actions

In the example below, we initialize the SDK in a Server Action

```tsx
import { ActionFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node';
import getSdk from '~/lib/sdk';
import getSupabaseServerClient from '~/core/supabase/server-client';

export async function action(args: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const client = getSupabaseServerClient(args.request);
  const sdk = getSdk(client);

  // ...
}
```

### Client Side

You may also initialize the SDK on the client side - but **bear in mind some API are not going to work in non-server environments**. This is useful if you need to interact with the core entities on the client side.

```tsx
import useSupabase from '~/core/supabase/use-supabase';

export function useSdk() {
  const client = useSupabase();

  return getSdk(client);
}
```
