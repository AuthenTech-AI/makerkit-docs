---

Most strings in the Makerkit template's application use `remix-i18next`, a
library to translate your application into multiple languages. Thanks to
this library, we can store all the application's text in `json` files for each supported language.

For example, if you are serving your application in English and Spanish, you'd have the following files:

- **English** translation files at `/public/locales/en/{file}.json`
- **Spanish** translation files at `/public/locales/es/{file}.json`

There are valid reasons to use translation files, even if you are not planning on translating your application, such as:

1. it's easier to search and replace text
2. tidier render functions
3. easy update path if you do decide to support a new language

### Adding new languages

By default, Makerkit uses English for translating the website's text. All the files are stored in the files at `/public/locales/en`.

Adding a new language is very simple:

1. **Translation Files**: First, we need to create a new folder, such as `/public/locales/es`, and then copy over the files from the English version and start translating files.
2. **Remix i18n config**: We need to also add a new language to the Remix
configuration at `app/i18n/i18next.config.ts`. Simply add your new
language's code to the `supportedLanguages` array.

The configuration will look like the below:

```js title="app/i18n/i18next.config.ts"
const i18Config = {
  fallbackLanguage: DEFAULT_LOCALE,
  supportedLanguages: [DEFAULT_LOCALE, 'es'],
  defaultNS: ['common', 'auth', 'organization', 'profile', 'subscription'],
  react: { useSuspense: false },
};
```

#### Setting the default Locale

To set the default locale, simply update the environment variable `DEFAULT_LOCALE` stored in `.env`.

So, open the `.env` file, and update the variable:

```txt title=".env"
DEFAULT_LOCALE=de
```
