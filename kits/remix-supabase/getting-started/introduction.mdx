MakerKit is **the Remix.js boilerplate project for SaaS** built to get you
started on the right foot.

The MakerKit kit is a fully-featured Remix application that uses Supabase for
authentication, database (with Postgres), and storage.

MakerKit is ideal for any SaaS application or dynamic websites such as walled Online Publications.

It particularly shines when you wish to provide uniform navigation between your marketing site, documentation, and application.

## What does the boilerplate provide?

### Tech Stack

We built MakerKit with some of the best technologies available today, such as
Remix, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase:

- **Scalable Remix** structure template, perfect for the most ambitious
projects
- Beautiful **Tailwind 3** CSS theme - with dark mode!
- **Full Supabase** setup, including Authentication, Database and Storage
- **Reusable UI components** as building blocks (which you can easily swap
with your own or your favorite library) based on [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.
com)
- **SSR-compatible Authentication flow**, including 3rd-party providers (Google,
Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.)

### Template Features

MakerKit is fully functioning from the beginning and comes with the
following features:

- **Payments** with Stripe, and support for **subscriptions** (or, alternatively, using Lemon Squeezy)
- **Onboarding flow**, which allows your users to set up their accounts and
create their organization
- **Organizations**: users can create and edit organizations. An organization is a group of users. You can rename the `Organization` entity according to your domain (for example, teams, projects, etc.)
- **Team Members**: users can invite other users to join their organization and assign them a role
- **MDX-powered Blog and Documentation** generators - already [Coming Soon]
**SEO-optimized** for you

### Marketing

Marketing matters! But don't get hung up on the technicalities. MakerKit provides:

- **Newsletter Sign-up form** for *ConvertKit*, but easy to adapt to more
providers
- **Email Templates** you can write with React using [React.email](https://react.email)

### Debugging and Testing

Never waste time chasing bugs again.

Assuming you have created a Sentry account, MakerKit can catch exceptions (and possible bugs) and  report them to Sentry whenever they happen in both client and server-side code:

- **Error Tracking** set up with Sentry
- Comprehensive **E2E Tests** suite with Cypress, which you can use and learn
from

### After you buy

You're not going to be left alone. We offer help and support:

- Access to the team for feedback, requests, and general support. **We're here to support you build your SaaS**.

This documentation introduces each of the points above and guides you through
so that you can easily adjust MakerKit to your application's domain.

MakerKit has plenty of resources for using both Remix and Supabase - and if you're stuck, you can always reach out to me for help.
