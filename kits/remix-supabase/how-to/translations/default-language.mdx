Setting a default language in your Remix Supabase application is easy.

Simply set the environment variable `DEFAULT_LOCALE` to the language code you want to use as the default language.

By default, we use `en` as the default language. If you want to change it, simply add the following line to your `.env` file. For example, if you want to use Spanish as the default language, you would add the following line to your `.env` file:

```bash
DEFAULT_LOCALE=es
```

Make sure to set this environment variable in your hosting provider as well for your production application.
