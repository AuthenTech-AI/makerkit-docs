The Makerkit repository adds some seed data by default for running the E2E tests.

To update the seed data, you will update the SQL file `supabase/seed.sql`. This file contains the SQL code that seeds the database everytime you start the Supabase Server using `npm run supabase:start`.

### Adding data to the seed file

If you'd like to extend this data with your own, update the data in your local environment, either by using your application or using the Supabase Studio interface.

Then, you can run the `diff` command:

```
supabase diff
```

This command will output the SQL code with the difference between the seed data and the current local DB data. You can copy and paste the outputted data into your `seed.sql` file.

The next database restarts will use the new data inserted.
