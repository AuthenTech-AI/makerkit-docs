If you have a logo for your company, you can easily update the favicons of your Makerkit applications. Favicons are the small icons that appear in the browser tab of your website.

### Where to find the favicons

Favicons are stored at `public/assets/images/favicon`. You can replace the existing files with your own images. If you keep the same names and sizes, then you don't need to update the code.

### How to generate favicons

If you do, I suggest to generate them using any o the online favicon generator, and then dropping the resulting images in the `public/assets/images/favicon` folder.

If you have different sizes and names, then you need to update the code to reflect these changes.

## How to update the favicons in Makerkit

This code is stored in the root `Head` component at `app/core/ui/Head.tsx`. You can update the code to match your new favicons.

```tsx title="app/core/ui/Head.tsx"
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/assets/images/favicon/favicon.ico" />

<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="144x144"
  href="/assets/images/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png"
/>

<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="16x16"
  href="/assets/images/favicon/favicon-16x16.png"
/>

<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  sizes="32x32"
  href="/assets/images/favicon/favicon-32x32.png"
/>

<link rel="manifest" href="/assets/images/favicon/site.webmanifest" />

<link
  rel="mask-icon"
  href="/assets/images/favicon/safari-pinned-tab.svg"
  color="#000000"
/>
```

Update the paths to match your new favicons.
