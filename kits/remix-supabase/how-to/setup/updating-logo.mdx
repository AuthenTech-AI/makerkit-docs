Makerkit by default provides an SVG logo with the default Makerkit logo. In addition, we also provide a `mini` version of the logo that is used when the sidebar is collapsed.

You should change both the `LogoImage` and `LogoImageMini` to match your brand.

### Where are the logos defined?

The logos are defined in two files:

1. `app/core/ui/Logo/LogoImage.tsx`
2. `app/core/ui/Logo/LogoImageMini.tsx`

Feel free to replace the default logo with your own logo.

### What sizes should my logo be?

The optimal sizes for the logs are:

1. The logos should be 20px tall to fit well in the header.
2. The logo mini should be 20px tall and 20px wide.

### I like Makerkit's logo! How can I reuse it for my own logo?

[Download the Makerkit Figma file from here](/assets/makerkit.fig) and use the logo from there.
