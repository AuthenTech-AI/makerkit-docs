This tutorial is a comprehensive guide to getting started with the Next.js and
Supabase SaaS template to build a basic tasks application, from fetching the repository to deploying
the application.

By the end, you'll have a fully working application with the minimum basics a SaaS needs:

1. Home Page and marketing pages (blog, pricing, FAQ)
2. Authentication (sign in, sign up, password reset)
3. Payments with Stripe
4. Profile Settings
5. Organization Settings
6. Tasks management with paginated Table and CRUD operations
7. Super Admin

## Prerequisites

To get started, you're going to need some things installed:

1. Git
2. Node.js version (LTS or greater)
3. npm 7 or greater
4. Docker - up and running
5. Your favorite code editor (VSCode, WebStorm, Zed, etc.)
6. To deploy your application, we recommend Vercel (but you can use any other provider)
7. A Stripe Account

Experience with React, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Supabase would be
advantageous but not strictly required. The codebase can also serve as a way to learn these topics more in-depth.

If you have all the above installed, let's get started!
