---

You have two ways to initialize the project:

1. Forking it from GitHub, or
2. Cloning it using Git, or
3. Using the Makerkit CLI (coming soon!)

### 1. Forking the Repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the "Fork" button on the top-right
corner in GitHub for the repository you want to use. Please be aware that by forking the repository, the Makerkit organization has read-only access to your forked repository.

Once you have forked the repository, clone it locally. Then, set the
upstream repository to the original repository, so you can pull updates
when needed:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit.git
```

### 2. Cloning the Repository

Alternatively, **assuming you have accepted the invites and have access to the repository**, open your terminal and run this command (replace `tasks-app` with your name of choice):

```
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit.git tasks-app
```

Once completed, we'll change into the `tasks-app` directory, and then we will install the Node modules:

```
cd tasks-app
npm i
```

### 3. Using the Makerkit CLI (coming soon!)

You can use the Makerkit CLI to create a new project based on this template. The CLI will ask you a few questions, and then it will create a new repository for you, and it will clone it locally.

Run the following command to run the CLI:

```
npx @makerkit/cli new
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions, and then it will create a new repository for you, and automatically install the Node modules.

### Reinitialize Git

As the Git repository's remote points to Makerkit's original repository, you can re-initialize (optionally!) the Git repository by running the following commands:

```
git remote rm origin
```

Now you have a clean Git repository.

### Setting the Upstream Repository

Then, we set the Makerkit repository as `upstream` - so we can pull updates when needed:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit.git
git add .
git commit -a -m "Initial Commit"
```

By adding the Makerkit's repository as `upstream` remote, you can fetch updates (after committing your files) by running the following command:

```
git pull upstream main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

If you have any conflicts, you can resolve them manually and then commit the changes. If the merge conflicts are too complex, accept your changes and discard the Makerkit's changes - then, you can manually merge the changes by looking at the diff in GitHub.

#### Remember to keep your forked repository up-to-date!

NB: as updates are released almost daily, remember to pull updates often!

Perfect! Now you can fire up your IDE and open the `tasks-app` project we just created.
