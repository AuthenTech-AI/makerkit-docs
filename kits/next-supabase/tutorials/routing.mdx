Before getting started with building our Tasks Pages, let's take a look at the default page structure of the boilerplate:

```txt
├── app
  └── layout.tsx

  └── onboarding

  (site)
    └── faq
    └── pricing

  └── auth
    └── link
    └── password-reset
    └── sign-in
    └── sign-up

  └── invite
    └── [code]
      └── page.tsx

  └── dashboard
    └── [organization]
      └── page.tsx

      └── settings
        └── organization
          └── members
            └── page.tsx
            └── invite
              └── page.tsx

        └── profile
          └── index
          └── email
          └── password
          └── authentication

        └── subscription

  └── page.tsx
```

The routes are split in the following way:

1. The website's pages are placed under `(site)`
2. The auth pages are placed under `auth`
3. The internal pages (behind auth) that are specific to organizations are placed under `dashboard/[organization]`
4. Some pages in the "middle" are placed outside `dashboard/[organization]`, such as the invites page and the onboarding flow.

### Setting the application's Home Page

By default, the application's home page is `/dashboard/[organization]`; every time the user logs in, they're redirected to the page `src/app/dashboard/[organization]/page.tsx`.

The path `dashboard` is also defined as `appPrefix` in the configuration file `src/configuration.tsx`: you can update this and rename the folder if you want to change the path.

To update the application's home page, you can update the `configuration.paths.appHome` variable in `src/configuration.tsx`.

### Demo: Tasks Application

Our demo application will be a simple tasks management application. We will be able to create tasks, list them, mark them as completed, and delete them.

Here is a quick demo of what we will build:

<Video src="/assets/images/posts/tasks-demo.mp4" />

### Routing

Ok, so we want to add three pages to our application:

1. **Tasks List**: A page to list all our tasks
2. **Task Detail**: A page specific to the selected task

To create these two pages, we will create a folder named `tasks` at `src/app/dashboard/[organization]/tasks`.

In the folder `src/app/dashboard/[organization]/tasks` we will create three `Page Components`:

1. The tasks list page at `tasks/page.tsx`
2. The task's own detail page at `tasks/[task]/page.tsx`.

```
├── app
  └── dashboard/[organization]
    └── tasks
      └── page.tsx

      └── [task]
        └── page.tsx
```

### Adding Functionalities to your application

To add new functionalities to your application (in our case, tasks management), usually, you'd need the following things:

1. **Data Model**: first, we want to define the data model of the feature you want to add
2. **Supabase Queries/Mutations**: once we're happy with the data model, we can create our Supabase DB queries/mutations
3. **Build Feature components**: then we can build the components of the feature (forms, lists, etc.)
4. **Add feature components into the pages**: finally, we add the components to the pages

### Adding page links to the Navigation Menu

#### Updating the Top header Navigation

To update the navigation menu, we need to update the `NAVIGATION_CONFIG` object in `src/navigation-config.tsx`. This object contains the links to the pages that are displayed in the top header menu.

1. The `label` is the text that will be displayed in the menu - it's a translation key that you can find in `locales/[lang]/common.json`
2. The `path` is the path to the page

```ts
const NAVIGATION_CONFIG = (organization: string) => ({
  items: [
    {
      label: 'common:dashboardTabLabel',
      path: getPath(organization, ''),
      Icon: ({ className }: { className: string }) => {
        return <Squares2X2Icon className={className} />;
      },
      end: true,
    },
    {
      label: 'common:tasksTabLabel',
      path: getPath(organization, 'tasks'),
      Icon: ({ className }: { className: string }) => {
        return <RectangleStackIcon className={className} />;
      },
    },
    {
      label: 'common:settingsTabLabel',
      path: getPath(organization, 'settings'),
      Icon: ({ className }: { className: string }) => {
        return <Cog8ToothIcon className={className} />;
      },
    },
  ],
});

function getPath(organizationId: string, path: string) {
  const appPrefix = configuration.paths.appPrefix;

  return [appPrefix, organizationId, path].filter(Boolean).join('/');
}
```

To add a new link to the header menu, follow the same convention:

1. Add a new item to the `items` array
2. Add the `label` and `path` properties
3. Make sure the `label` is a translation key that you can find in `locales/[lang]/common.json`
4. Add the `Icon` property if you want to display an icon next to the label
5. Make sure the `path` is correct

The result will be similar to the images below:
