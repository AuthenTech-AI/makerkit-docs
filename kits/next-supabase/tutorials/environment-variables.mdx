The starter project comes with two different environment variables files:
1. **.env**: the main environment file - use this for variables that are common to all environments - and that are not secrets.
2. **.env.development**: the development environment file (used when running the project locally in development mode) - when they're specific to the development environment.
3. **.env.production**: the production environment file (used when deploying or running the build command) - when they're specific to the production environment.
4. **.env.local**: this environment file is loaded when running the project locally. It won't be committed to Git. Useful for adding secrets that you don't want to commit to Git.
5. **.env.test**: this environment file is loaded when running the Cypress E2E tests. You would rarely need to use this.
