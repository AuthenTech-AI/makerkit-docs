Sometimes, Supabase may not be able to start. This can happen for a number of reasons, but the most common is that the port you are trying to use is already in use by another application.

## Is Docker running?

To start Supabase in development mode, you need to have Docker running. If you don't have Docker running, Supabase will not be able to start.

Please download any Docker-compatible application (Docker Desktop, Colima, Orbstack) and make sure it is running before starting Supabase.

## Is Supabase already running?

If Supabase is already running, then it will not be able to start again. You can check if Supabase is already running by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker ps
```

If yes, you can kill them all using the following command:

```bash
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

NB: this command will shut down **all running Docker containers**.

To shut down Supabase, you can run the following command from your application's root directory:

```bash
npm run supabase:stop
```

If you have 2 different Supabase projects running, you can stop them individually by running the following command:

```bash
npm run supabase:stop
```

If you run this command from a different project, it will not stop the Supabase instance running in your current project. So make sure you are in the right directory before running this command.
