For oAuth - you can enable multiple providers. For example, you can enable Google and Facebook authentication at the same time by adding the providers to the `auth.providers.oAuth` array in the configuration file at `src/configuration.ts`.

You must configure the oAuth providers in three places:
1. **Supabase** - you need to setup an oAuth application in Supabase.
2. **Provider** - you need to setup an oAuth application in the provider (for example, Google Auth)
3. **Makerkit Configuration** - you need to add the provider to the `auth.providers.oAuth` array in the configuration file at `src/configuration.ts`.

Below is an example of how to enable Google and Facebook authentication:

```tsx title="src/configuration.ts" {5}
providers: {
  emailPassword: false,
  phoneNumber: false,
  emailLink: false,
  oAuth: ['google', 'facebook'] as Provider[]
},
```

The interface `Provider` is very important as it tells Makerkit which OAuth provider to use. You can find the list of [supported OAuth providers here](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth#third-party-logins).

By default, Makerkit provides logos for the most famous oAuth providers, but not all of them. To add a logo for an oAuth provider, please update the `src/core/ui/AuthProviderLogo.tsx` file.

You will provide a string or a React node for the logo by specifying the provider name as the key of the object.

```tsx title="src/core/ui/AuthProviderLogo.tsx"
function getOAuthProviderLogos(): Record<string, string | React.ReactNode> {
  return {
    password: <AtSymbolIcon className={'h-[22px] w-[22px]'} />,
    phone: <DevicePhoneMobileIcon className={'h-[22px] w-[22px]'} />,
    google: '/assets/images/google.webp',
    facebook: '/assets/images/facebook.webp',
    twitter: '/assets/images/twitter.webp',
    github: '/assets/images/github.webp',
    microsoft: '/assets/images/microsoft.webp',
    apple: '/assets/images/apple.webp',
  };
}
```

### How to Setup an oAuth Provider

Most of the setup is done in two places:

1. **Supabase** - you need to setup an oAuth application in Supabase.
2. **Provider** - you need to setup an oAuth application in the provider (for example, Google Auth)

To know more about how to setup an oAuth provider, please read the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth#third-party-logins).
