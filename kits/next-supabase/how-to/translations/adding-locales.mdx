To add a new locale to your application, you need to create a new file in the `public/locales` directory.

For example, to add a new language called `fr` (French), you would create a new file called `fr.json` in the `public/locales` directory.

```json
{
  "hello": "Bonjour"
}
```

That's it! Now you can use the `hello` key in your application and it will be translated to `Bonjour` when the locale is set to `fr`.
