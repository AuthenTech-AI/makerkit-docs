By default, the language switcher is not used within the Next.js Supabase starter. To use it, you will need to import it into your application and add it to your layout.

To do so, import the `LanguageSwitcher` component from the `components` directory and add it to any component you want to display it in.

```tsx
import { LanguageSwitcher } from '~/components/LanguageSwitcher';

export const YourComponent = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <LanguageSwitcher />
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The language switcher will automatically display the current language and a list of available languages. When a user clicks on a language, the language will be updated in the user's profile and the page will be reloaded.
