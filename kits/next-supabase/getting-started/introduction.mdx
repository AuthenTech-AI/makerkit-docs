MakerKit is **the Next.js boilerplate project for SaaS** built to get you
started on the right foot.

The MakerKit kit is a fully-featured Next.js application that uses Supabase for
authentication, database (with Postgres), and storage.

This version of the kit uses the new App Router introduced with Next.js 13, which is built on top of the new React Server Components.

## What does the boilerplate provide?

### Tech Stack

We built MakerKit with some of the best technologies available today, such as
Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase:

- **Scalable Next.js RSC (app directory)** structure template, perfect for the most ambitious
projects
- Beautiful **Tailwind 3** CSS theme - with dark mode!
- **Full Supabase** setup, including Authentication, Database and Storage
- **Reusable UI components** as building blocks (which you can easily swap
with your own or your favorite library) based on [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com)
- **SSR-compatible Authentication flow**, including 3rd-party providers (Google,
Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.)

### Template Features

MakerKit is fully functioning from the beginning and comes with the
following features:

- **Payments** with Stripe, and support for **subscriptions** (or, alternatively, using Lemon Squeezy)
- **Onboarding flow**, which allows your users to set up their accounts and
create their organization
- **Organizations**: users can create and edit organizations. An organization is a group of users. You can rename the `Organization` entity according to your domain (for example, teams, projects, etc.)
- **Team Members**: users can invite other users to join their organization and assign them a role
- **MDX-powered Blog and Documentation** generators - already **SEO-optimized** for you [Coming Soon]

### Marketing

Marketing matters! But don't get hung up on the technicalities. MakerKit provides:

- **Newsletter Sign-up form** for *ConvertKit*, but easy to adapt to more
providers
- **Email Templates** you can write with React using [React.email](https://react.email)

### Debugging and Testing

Never waste time chasing bugs again.

Assuming you have created a Sentry account, MakerKit can catch exceptions (and possible bugs) and  report them to Sentry whenever they happen in both client and server-side code:

- **Error Tracking** set up with Sentry
- Comprehensive **E2E Tests** suite with Cypress, which you can use and learn
from
