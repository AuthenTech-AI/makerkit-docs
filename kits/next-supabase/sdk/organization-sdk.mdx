The Organization SDK allows you to interact with the currently selected Organization. Here we list the methods available in the Organization SDK.

The example below work within a Server Components: by using the required client, you can easily adapt the code examples below to both Server Actions and Route Handlers.

The Organization's SDK is namespaced under `sdk.organization` - so all the methods below are available under `sdk.organization`.

## Fetch the current Organization UID

To fetch the currently selected user's organization UID, use the `getCurrentOrganizationUid` method:

```tsx
import getSdk from '~/lib/sdk';
import getSupabaseServerComponentClient from '~/core/supabase/server-component-client';

async function PageServerComponent() {
  const client = getSupabaseServerComponentClient();
  const sdk = getSdk(client);

  const organizationUid = await sdk.organization.getCurrentOrganizationUid();
}
```

The UID may be `null` - so do make sure to check for that. For example, you may want to redirect the user to the Organizations page if no organization is selected:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

import getSdk from '~/lib/sdk';
import getSupabaseServerComponentClient from '~/core/supabase/server-component-client';

async function PageServerComponent() {
  const client = getSupabaseServerComponentClient();
  const sdk = getSdk(client);

  const organizationUid = await sdk.organization.getCurrentOrganizationUid();

  if (!organizationUid) {
    // No organization selected
    redirect('/organizations')
  }
}
```

## Fetch the current Organization

To fetch the currently selected user's organization, use the `getCurrent` method:

```tsx
import getSdk from '~/lib/sdk';
import getSupabaseServerComponentClient from '~/core/supabase/server-component-client';

async function PageServerComponent() {
  const client = getSupabaseServerComponentClient();
  const sdk = getSdk(client);

  const organization = await sdk.organization.getCurrent();
}
```

The `getCurrent` method returns the interface `GetCurrentOrganizationResponse` which is defined as:

```ts
interface GetCurrentOrganizationResponse {
  organization: {
    id: number;
    uuid: string;
    name: string;
    logoURL?: string | null;

    // your custom fields...

    subscription?: {
      customerId: string | undefined;

      // your custom fields...

      data: {
        id: string;

        priceId: string;

        status: Stripe.Subscription.Status;
        cancelAtPeriodEnd: boolean;
        currency: string | null;

        interval: string | null;
        intervalCount: number | null;

        createdAt: string;
        periodStartsAt: string;
        periodEndsAt: string;
        trialStartsAt: string | null;
        trialEndsAt: string | null;

        // your custom fields ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Alert type={'warn'}>
  <Alert.Heading>
    This can change if you have a custom Organization model.
  </Alert.Heading>

  It's very likely that you will be updating the Organization model to include more fields. If that's the case, this
  method will reflect those changes.
</Alert>

## Fetch the current Organization's Subscription

The `organization` namespace also includes a `subscription` namespace. This namespace allows you to interact with the current Organization's subscription.

We will show it in the next section.
