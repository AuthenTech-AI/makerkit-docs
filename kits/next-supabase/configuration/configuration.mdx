application with Next.js and Supabase"

We store the global configuration of a MakerKit application in `/configuration.ts`.

Within any application file, we can use the path `~/configuration` to
import it from any other file.

<Alert type='info'>
You do not need any changes to start developing your application. Feel free
to complete the configuration once you want to deploy the app for the first
time.
</Alert>

The configuration has the following structure:

```typescript title="app/configuration.ts"
export default {
  site: {
    name: '',
    description: '',
    themeColor: '#ffffff',
    themeColorDark: '#0a0a0a',
    siteUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
    siteName: '',
    twitterHandle: '',
    githubHandle: '',
    language: 'en',
    convertKitFormId: '',
    locale: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LOCALE,
  },
  paths: {
    signIn: '/auth/sign-in',
    signUp: '/auth/sign-up',
    emailLinkSignIn: '/auth/link',
    onboarding: `/onboarding`,
    appHome: '/tasks',
    settings: {
      profile: '/settings/profile',
      authentication: '/settings/profile/authentication',
      email: '/settings/profile/email',
      password: '/settings/profile/password',
    },
    api: {
      checkout: `/api/stripe/checkout`,
      billingPortal: `/api/stripe/portal`,
      organizations: {
        create: `/api/organizations`,
        current: `/api/organizations/[organization]/current`,
        transferOwnership: `/api/organizations/owner`,
        members: `/api/organizations/members`,
        member: `/api/organizations/members/[member]`,
      },
    },
  },
  auth: {
    requireEmailConfirmation:
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION === 'true',
    // NB: Enable the providers below in the Supabase Console
    // in your production project
    providers: {
      emailPassword: true,
      phoneNumber: false,
      emailLink: false,
      oAuth: ['google'],
    },
  },
  environment: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT,
  production: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  features: {
    enableThemeSwitcher: true,
  },
  theme: Themes.Light,
  stripe: {
    products: [
      {
        name: 'Basic',
        description: 'Describe your basic plan',
        plans: [
          {
            price: '$249/year',
            stripePriceId: '<STRIPE_PRICE_ID>',
          }
        ],
      },
      {
        name: 'Pro',
        description: 'Describe your pro plan',
        plans: [
          {
            price: '$249/year',
            stripePriceId: '<STRIPE_PRICE_ID>',
          }
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

These values are used throughout the application instead of being hardcoded into the codebase. You can assign public environment variables to these values to make them available in your application.

## Environment Variables

Makerkit provides templates for configuring your environment variables correctly and the **minimum** environment variables to run your local environment.

To push your project to production, **you must fill these variables by creating your Supabase project** and adding the required values.

### Development Environment Variables

The development environment variables set your application up for the
Supabase environment:

```
DEFAULT_LOCALE=en
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# SUPABASE
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# EMAIL
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SENDER='MakerKit Team <info@makerkit.dev>'
```

#### Use your CI/CD to set environment variables for your production environment

Some of the variables above are secret. We show them here and in the .env files for clarity, but you should **never** commit them to your repository.

**You must add these from your CI/CD environment**. For example, if you use Vercel, you can add them in the project settings.

```
# SUPABASE
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=

# EMAIL -
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SENDER='MakerKit Team <info@makerkit.dev>'
```

If you wish, you can safely add public or non-secret variables to your `.env.production` file for your production environment, such as your production site URL. This is fine.
