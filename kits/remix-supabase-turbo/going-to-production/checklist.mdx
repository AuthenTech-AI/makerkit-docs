When you are ready to go to production, please follow the checklist below. This is an overview, a more detailed guide will be provided in the future.

This could take a couple of hours and some trial and error, so buckle up - you're almost there!

1. **Create a Supabase project**. [Link the project locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project) using the Supabase CLI (`supabase link`).
2. **Migrations**: [Push the migrations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project) to the remote Supabase instance (`supabase db push`).
3. **Auth**: [Set your APP URL in the Supabase project settings](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls). This is required for the OAuth flow. Make sure to add the path `/auth/callback` to the allowed URLs. If you don't have it yet, wait.
4. **Auth Providers**: [Set the OAuth providers in the Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login) project settings. If you use Google Auth, make sure to set it up. This requires creating a Google Cloud project and setting up the OAuth credentials.
5. **Auth Emails**: It is very much recommended to update the auth emails using the [following documentation](authentication-emails). The kit already implements the `confirm` route, but you need to update the emails in your Supabase settings.
6. **Deploy Remix**: Deploy the Remix app to Vercel or any another hosting provider. Copy the URL and set it in the Supabase project settings.
7. **Environment Variables**: The initial deploy **will likely fail** because you may not yet have a URL to set in your environment variables. This is normal. Once you have the URL, set the URL in the environment variables and redeploy.
8. **Webhooks**: [Set the DB Webhooks in Supabase](configuring-supabase-database-webhooks) pointing against your Next.js app at `/api/db/webhooks`.
9. **Emails**: Get some SMTP details from an email service provider like SendGrid or Mailgun or Resend and configure the emails in both the Environment Variables and the [Supabase project settings](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp).
10. **Billing**: Create a Stripe/Lemon Squeezy account, make sure to update the environment variables with the correct values. Point webhooks from these to `/api/billing/webhook`. Please use the relative documentation for more details.
