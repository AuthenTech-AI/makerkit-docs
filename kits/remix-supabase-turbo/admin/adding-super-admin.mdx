The Super Admin panel allows you to manage users and accounts.

To access the super admin panel at `/admin`, you will need to assign a user as a super admin.

To do so, pick the user ID of the user you want to assign as a super admin and run the following SQL query:

```sql
UPDATE auth.users SET raw_app_meta_data = raw_app_meta_data || '{"role": "super-admin"}' WHERE id='<user_id>';
```

Please replace `<user_id>` with the user ID you want to assign as a super admin.
