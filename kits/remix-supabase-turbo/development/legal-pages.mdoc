Legal pages are defined in the `apps/web/app/(marketing)/(legal)` directory.

Makerkit comes with the following legal pages:

1. Terms and Conditions
2. Privacy Policy
3. Cookie Policy

For obvious reasons, **these pages are empty and you need to fill in the content**.

Do yourself a favor and do not use ChatGPT to generate these pages.

### Using a CMS for legal pages

You can use a CMS to manage the content of the legal pages. To do this, use the [CMS Client](content/cms):

```tsx
import { createCmsClient } from '@kit/cms';

export async function MyPage() {
  const cms = await createCmsClient();

  const { title, content } = await cms.getContentBySlug({
    slug: `slug`,
    collection: `pages`
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: content }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
