The `Video` component is used to display videos in your webpage using the HTML5 video tag.

```tsx
import { Video } from '~/core/ui/Video';

<Video src='/videos/video.mp4' />
```

The `Video` component is automatically lazy loaded, meaning that the video will only be loaded when it is visible in the viewport.

While loading, the `Video` component will display a loading indicator. Once the video is loaded, the loading indicator will be replaced by the video.

### Props

1. `src` - The source of the video.
2. `className` - The class name to apply to the video element.
3. `poster` - The poster image to display before the video is loaded.
4. `width` - The width of the video.
5. `type` - The type of the video. Defaults to `video/mp4`.
