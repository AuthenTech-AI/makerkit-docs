## Basic Usage - Default

The basic usage of the Stepper component is to display a progress bar with a set of steps. It is used to indicate the current position in a process. By default, we display the `default` style.

```tsx
<Stepper 
  steps={['Details', 'Organization', "Complete"]} 
  currentStep={0} 
/> 
```

<DemoContainer>
  <div className="max-w-md w-full">
    <Stepper steps={['Details', 'Organization', "Complete"]} currentStep={0} />
  </div>
</DemoContainer>

### Numbers variant

The `numbers` variant displays the step number instead of the default dot.

```tsx
<Stepper 
  steps={['Details', 'Organization', "Complete"]} 
  currentStep={0} 
  variant="numbers"
/>
```

<DemoContainer>
  <div className="max-w-md w-full">
    <Stepper steps={['Details', 'Organization', "Complete"]} currentStep={0} variant="numbers" />
  </div>
</DemoContainer>

### Props

The following props may be passed to configure the Stepper component.

1. `steps` - An array of strings that represent the steps in the stepper. You can also pass translation keys to localize the stepper, such as `common.step1`.
2. `currentStep` - The current step in the stepper. This is a zero-based index.
3. `variant` - The variant of the stepper. The default is `default`. The other option is `numbers`.
