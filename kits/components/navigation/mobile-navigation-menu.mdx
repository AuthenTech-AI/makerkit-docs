The mobile navigation menu is a menu that is only visible on mobile devices. It is used to navigate the site on mobile devices. It uses the `Dropdown` component to display the menu items with a full-width panel.

It can be used with the `NavigationMenu` component to display the same menu on desktop and mobile devices - while keeping the correct visibility on each device using Tailwind's responsive classes.

```tsx
import { MobileNavigationMenu } from '~/core/ui/MobileNavigationMenu';

<div className={'block w-full lg:hidden'}>
  <MobileNavigationMenu 
    links={[{
      label: 'Home',
      path: '/',
    }, {
      label: 'About',
      path: '/about',
    }]}
  />
</div>
```

<DemoContainer>
  <MobileNavigationMenu
    links={[{
      label: 'Home',
      path: '/docs/components/mobile-navigation-menu'
    }, {
      label: 'About',
      path: '/about',
    }]}
  />
