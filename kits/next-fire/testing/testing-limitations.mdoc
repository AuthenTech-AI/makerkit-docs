Due to the hard-to-rollback nature of some tests (such as accepting invitations) - some Tests won't work well in development mode.

To have a clean testing environment at each run, we recommend running the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Of course, some of the tests will work just fine, but not the ones related to accepting invites.

This would be solved if we could reset the Firebase Firestore data programmatically between test runs, but as far as we know this is not yet possible.
