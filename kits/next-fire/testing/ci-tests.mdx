To run your tests in any CI, we recommend you simply run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command takes care of running all the required services, importing the test data, executing the tests and then exiting.

### The Makerkit testing pipeline

As mentioned in the previous section, testing a Makerkit requires a few services to be up and running:

- the Next.js server
- the Firebase emulators
- optionally, the Stripe Mock server

While executing these tests in your CI, this can get cumbersome. Therefore, we provided a single script to execute all your tests in one simple command: you can find the script at `scripts/test.sh`, which will contain the following content:

```bash
set -e

npm run dev:test & npm run stripe:mock-server &
npm run cypress:headless
sh scripts/kill-ports.sh
```

Let's explain it, so you can add your own modifications to it.

The first command will run (in parallel and in the background) the Next.js server and the Stripe mock server:

```bash
npm run dev:test & npm run stripe:mock-server &
```

Afterward, we execute the Cypress tests in headless mode:

```bash
npm run cypress:headless
```

Finally, we clean up all the ports that may have remained open after executing the script:

```bash
sh scripts/kill-ports.sh
```

If you update your ports, remember to change them also in `scripts/kill-ports.sh`.

### Running the Tests in CI mode

Finally, the tests can be executed with the command `npm test`. 

This command **will automatically run the Firebase emulators** and the `test.sh` script, and is defined as:

```bash
"test": "firebase emulators:exec --project demo-makerkit --import ./firebase-seed \"sh ./scripts/test.sh\"",
```

When finished, the emulators will exit.
