Sometimes - you don't want to enable payments yet. That's fine. You can disable Stripe in your MakerKit project.

## Disable Stripe

First, set `configuration.stripe.embedded` to `false` in the global configuration file.

```tsx title="src/configuration.ts"
{
  ...
  stripe: {
    embedded: false,
  },
  ...
}
```

You also want to delete or hide the page where users can subscribe to your product.

You can do so by removing the 'Subscriptions' page from the settings navigation at `src/components/settings/SettingsPageContainer.tsx`.

```tsx title="src/components/settings/SettingsPageContainer.tsx"
const links = [
  {
    path: '/settings/profile',
    i18n: 'common:profileSettingsTabLabel',
  },
  {
    path: '/settings/organization',
    i18n: 'common:organizationSettingsTabLabel',
  },
  /*
  {
    path: '/settings/subscription',
    i18n: 'common:subscriptionSettingsTabLabel',
  },
   */
];
```

You can re-add the page later when you are ready to enable payments.
