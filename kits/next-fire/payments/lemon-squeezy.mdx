If you prefer using Lemon Squeezy instead of Stripe with your Makerkit kit, we provide a different branch from the main repository that you can use.

The branch is called `main-ls`. If you want to use Lemon Squeezy, you can clone the repository and checkout the `main-ls` branch.

NB: the integration is in beta, and I am working on improving it.

## Setting up Lemon Squeezy

### Step 1: Create a Lemon Squeezy account

First, you need to create a Lemon Squeezy account. You can do so by visiting [https://lemonsqueezy.io](https://lemonsqueezy.com).

Get your store setup (start in Test mode, so you don't need to wait for activation).

### Step 2: Create a Product/Variant in Lemon Squeezy

You can see this guide for [setting up SaaS subscription plans in Lemon Squeezy](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/tutorials/saas-subscription-plans).

If you want, set up a monthly/annual plan for your product, or just a single plan.

To replicate the basic Makerkit subscription plans, you can create a plan for each of the following: Basic, Pro and Premium plans.

To get started quickly, you can also set up a single plan for your product.

### Step 3: Create a Lemon Squeezy API key

Now, we need to setup an API Key. Go to your Lemon Squeezy settings page and click on the [API Keys tab](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/products).

Click on the "Create API Key" button and give it a **very specific name**, so you won't confuse it with your production keys. Copy the API key and ensure to store it. We will be adding this to your Makerkit's local environment variables file.

<Image src="/assets/images/posts/lemon-squeezy-api-key-name.webp" width={"946"} height={"614"} />

Depending on which kit you're using, you will add this key to either `.env.local` (Next.js) or `.env` (Remix). This key is not supposed to be committed to your repository, so we add them safely to our local files.

Additionally, we need to add the `LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID` to the local environment variables file, and a secret string `LEMON_SQUEEZY_SIGNING_SECRET` that we use to verify the webhook signature.

Update them in your local environment variables file:

```bash
LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>
LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID=<YOUR_STORE_ID>
LEMONS_SQUEEZY_SIGNATURE_SECRET=<a random string>
```

#### Find your Lemon Squeezy Store ID

To find your Lemon Squeezy Store ID, visit your `Stores` page in the Lemon Squeezy dashboard.

You can do so by visiting the following URL: [https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/stores](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/stores).

The ID is the number next to the store name.

Proceed by copying the Store ID into the `LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID` environment variable.

## Step 4: Configure Lemon Squeezy plans in the Makerkit configuration

Now, we need to configure the Lemon Squeezy plans in the Makerkit configuration, and enter the correct plan IDs.

To do so, open the `~/configuration.ts` file and edit the `stripe` object.

We can convert this to something more abstract, such as `subscriptions`, and add the relevant Lemon Squeezy product and variant IDs.

```ts title="src/configuration.ts"
{
  subscriptions: {
    products: [
      {
        name: 'Basic',
        description: 'Description of your Basic plan',
        badge: `Up to 20 users`,
        productId: 1, // <-- Lemon Squeezy product ID
        features: [
          'Basic Reporting',
          'Up to 20 users',
          '1GB for each user',
          'Chat Support',
        ],
        plans: [
          {
            name: 'Monthly',
            price: '$9',
            variantId: 1, // <-- Lemon Squeezy variant ID
          },
          {
            name: 'Yearly',
            price: '$90',
            variantId: 2, // <-- Lemon Squeezy variant ID
          },
        ],
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `variantId` is the ID of the plan in Lemon Squeezy. The `productId` is the ID of the product.

##### Find your Lemon Squeezy product and variant IDs

You can find your Lemon Squeezy Product and Variant IDs using the Lemon Squeezy dashboard.

### Step 4: Creating the Webhook In Lemon Squeezy

We need to create a Webhook from the Lemon Squeezy Dashboard so that we can receive the events to our webhook handler.

You will be prompted for the following:

- URL: point it to the ngrok URL (see below). Ensure you point it to the `/api/ls/webhook` endpoint.
- Secret: the secret `LEMON_SQUEEZY_SIGNING_SECRET` that you have set in the `.env` file
- Events: select the events that you want to receive. In our case, we want to receive the `subscription_created` and `subscription_updated` events.

<Image src="/assets/images/posts/lemon-squeezy-webhook-setup.webp" width={"1118"} height={"1666"} />

#### Testing Locally

To test the webhook handler locally, we can use the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tool.

We add the following command to the `package.json` file:

```bash
"ngrok": "npx ngrok http 3000"
```

And you can run it with:

```bash
npm run ngrok
```

You can also use other alternatives, such as Localtunnel or Cloudflare Tunnel.

### Step 5: Go to production

Once you're ready to go to production, you can **switch your Lemon Squeezy store to production mode**.

Additionally, remember to **set up the webhook in production mode as well**, pointing to your production URL.

Finally, **update all the environment variables** to the production values.
