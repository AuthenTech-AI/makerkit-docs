documentation website for your Next.js application'

MakerKit has both Blogs and a Documentation site built in so that you can
start working on your content even before you launch your product.

We placed the sections together because, naturally, Blog and Docs share a good amount of code.

We can write the Blog posts and the documentation pages using [MDX
files](https://mdxjs.com/).

Thanks to MDX, we can augment the built-in components with richer styling and more complex components.
