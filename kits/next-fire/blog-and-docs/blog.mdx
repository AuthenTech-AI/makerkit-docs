We can add your website's blog posts within the `_posts` folder.

## Collections

Before writing a blog post, we have to define the post's collection. We use `collections` to organize our blog posts by their category.

For example, your blog could have collections such as changelog,
announcements, tutorials, etc.

MakerKit generates every collection with its page, listing all the articles
associated with it.

To change a collection page, please change the file `src/pages/blog/[collection].ts`.

### Adding collections

Let's see how we can define a `collection` in Typescript:

```tsx
interface Collection {
  name: string;

  // image
  logo?: string;
  emoji?: string;
}
````

As you can see, the only required property to create a collection is a name. You can also attach an image or a simple emoji for each collection.

A collection can be simply the following file:

```json
{
  "name":"Changelog"
}
```

## Writing a Blog Post
The interface of a blog post is the following:

```tsx
interface Post {
  title: string;
  excerpt: string;

  date: string;
  live: boolean;
  tags?: string[];

  coverImage?: string;

  ogImage?: {
    url: string;
  };

  author?: {
    name: string;
    picture: string;
    url: string;
  };

  canonical?: string;
}
```

These values can be defined in MDX files using the `frontmatter`, for example:

```yaml
---
title: An Awesome Post title
except: "Write here a short description for your blog post"
collection: changelog.json
date: '2022-01-05'
live: true
coverImage: '/assets/images/posts/announcement.webp'
tags:
  - changelog
  - coolstuff
---
```

#### Title
The property `title` is the title of the blog post.

NB: it does not correspond to the URL. The URL
segment, instead, is defined by the name of the file.

#### Excerpt
Write a short description for your blog post. This description will also
populate the relative meta tags.

#### Collection
The property `collection` is the path to the collection associated with the blog post.

NB: the `.json` extension needs to be part of the name.

#### Live
You can choose to publish or not a blog post by setting this property to `false`.

### Cover Image
The property `coverImage` is the path to the post's image.

### Tags
A list of tags you can attach to the post.

For each tag, MakerKit generates a page with every blog post associated, which you can update at `src/pages/blog/tags/[tag.tsx]`.
