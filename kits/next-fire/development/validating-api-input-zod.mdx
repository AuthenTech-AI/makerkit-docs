[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) is a Typescript library that helps us
secure our API endpoints by validating the payloads sent
from the client and also facilitating the typing of the payloads with
Typescript.

Using Zod is the first line of defense to validate the data sent against our
API: as a result, it's something we recommend you keep doing. It ensures we
write safe, resilient, and valid code.

All Makerkit's API routes are secured with Zod: in this document, we want
to explain the conventions used by the SaaS Boilerplate, and how to use it
for your API endpoints.

When we write an API endpoint, we first define the schema of the payload:

```tsx
function getBodySchema() {
  return z.object({
    displayName: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
  });
}
```

This function represents the schema, which will validate the following
interface:

```tsx
interface Body {
  displayName: string;
  email: Email;
}
```

Now, let's write the body of the API handler that validates the body of the
function, which we expect to be equal to the `Body` interface.

```tsx
import { throwBadRequestException } from `~/core/http-exceptions`;

function inviteMemberHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  try {
     // we can safely use data with the interface Body
    const schema = getBodySchema();
    const { displayName, email } = schema.parse(req.body);

    return sendInvite({ displayName, email });
  } catch(e) {
    return throwBadRequestException(res);
  }
}

export default function apiHandler() {
  const handler = withPipe(
    withMethodsGuard(['POST']),
    withAuthedUser,
    inviteMemberHandler,
  );

  // manage exceptions
  return withExceptionFilter(req, res)(handler);
}
```

You can also use `safeParse` if you prefer not to throw an error when the
validation fails:

```tsx
function inviteMemberHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
) {
  const schema = getBodySchema();
  const result = schema.safeParse(req.body);

  // we use result.success as a type guard
  // when false, we throw an exception
  if (!result.success) {
    return throwBadRequestException(res);
  }

  // TS correctly infers result.data now
  return sendInvite(result.data);
}
```
