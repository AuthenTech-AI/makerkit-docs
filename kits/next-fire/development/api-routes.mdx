Makerkit provides various utilities to reduce the boilerplate needed to write API functions with Next.js.

The simpler API route you could write is the following:

```tsx
export default function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  return res.send(`Hello World`)
}
```

Of course, there isn't much in there! But any SaaS will need various checks
before executing an handler, for example:

1. checking if the request is authenticated
2. validating the request isn't from a bot
3. validating the payload matches your expected schema
4. validating the endpoint matches the expected method
5. ...and so on!

Thankfully, Makerkit allows you to do all the above thanks to `middlewares`,
simple function that accept the Next,js `req` and `res` API parameters.

Normally, as you will see in the codebase, we writeAPI handlers
using the conventions below:

```tsx title="/pages/api/members.ts"
import { withAuthedUser } from '~/core/middleware/with-authed-user';
import { withPipe } from '~/core/middleware/with-pipe';
import { withMethodsGuard } from '~/core/middleware/with-methods-guard';
import { withExceptionFilter } from '~/core/middleware/with-exception-filter';
import { withAppCheck } from '~/core/middleware/with-app-check';
import { withAdmin } from '~/core/middleware/with-admin';

const SUPPORTED_METHODS: HttpMethod[] = ['GET', 'POST'];

export default function members(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const handler = withPipe(
    // throw if method is not in SUPPORTED_METHODS array
    withMethodsGuard(SUPPORTED_METHODS),
    // initialize Firebase Admin
    withAdmin,
    // check request is genuine with Firebase AppCheck
    withAppCheck,
    // check user is authenticated
    withAuthedUser,
    // execute API logic
    membersHandler
  );

  // manage exceptions
  return withExceptionFilter(req, res)(handler);
}

async function membersHandler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const members = await fetchOrganizationMembers();

  res.json(members);
}
```

Let's take a look at these functions individually.

### Piping functions

Piping functions can be useful to augment a function, validate data, or do any other check before getting to the function handler, where we write the bulk of the logic.

The utility we use is `withPipe`, a dead-simple function that iterates over functions until one of them stops (or calls functions such as `req.end()`, `req.send()`, `req.json()`).

```tsx
export default withPipe(
  (req, res) => {
    if (req.method !== 'POST') {
      res.status(409).end();
    }
  },
  (req, res) => {
    // this will never execute!
  }
)
```

### Guarding against unsupported HTTP methods

This utility helps reject requests whose method is not defined in the array.

For example, let's assume we only want to reply to `GET` and `POST` requests:

```tsx title="/api/hello.ts"
import { withMethodsGuard } from '~/core/middleware/with-methods-guard';

export default withPipe(
  withMethodsGuard(['GET', 'POST'])
);
```

Alternatively, call it at the top of an API route:

```tsx
export default async function apiHandler() {
  await withMethodsGuard(['PUT']);
}
```

If the API is called with any other HTTP method, this function will throw a 405 error and add an `Allow` HTTP header with the list of allowed methods.

### Initializing the Firebase Admin

To be able to use the Firebase Admin functions in your Next.js API, you need to initialize it before calling its services, such as Firestore, Auth, etc.

```tsx
import { withAdmin } from '~/core/middleware/with-admin';

export default withPipe(
  withAdmin,
);
```

Alternatively, call it at the top of an API route:

```tsx
export default async function apiHandler() {
  await withAdmin();
}
```

### Rejecting requests from non-authenticated users

This is one of the most important functions you will be using, i.e. ensuring the API request is coming from an authenticated user:

```tsx
import { withAuthedUser } from '~/core/middleware/with-authed-user';

export default withPipe(
  withAuthedUser,
);
```

Alternatively, call it at the top of an API route:

```tsx
export default async function apiHandler() {
  await withAuthedUser();
}
```

### Rejecting requests from bots

If you enabled AppCheck in your application, you can disallow requests from bad actors and spammy clients:

```tsx
import { withAppCheck } from '~/core/middleware/with-app-check';

export default withPipe(
  withAdmin,
  withAppCheck,
);
```

Alternatively, call it at the top of an API route:

```tsx
export default async function apiHandler() {
  await withAdmin();
  await withAppCheck();
}
```

### Handling Exceptions

The utility `withExceptionFilter` is useful for managing exceptions from an API handler.

This utility will report the exception to `Sentry.io` (if configured), log the exception so that you can debug it, and return a JSON with some metadata to **avoid leaking information to the clients**: therefore, I highly encourage you to use this utility where possible.

Check out the example below:

```tsx
export default function apiHandler() {
  const handler = withPipe(
    withMethodsGuard(SUPPORTED_METHODS),
    withAuthedUser,
    (req, res) => {
      return await getData();
    }
  );

  // manage exceptions
  return withExceptionFilter(req, res)(handler);
}
```
