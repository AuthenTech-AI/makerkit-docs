There are several ways to fetch the signed in user, depending on the use-case.

## Fetching the signed in user from the backend

To do so, use the function `getLoggedInUser` where you have access to the request object, such as in a Next.js API route, or `getServerSideProps` function.

```tsx
import { GetServerSidePropsContext } from "next";
import { getLoggedInUser } from '~/core/firebase/admin/auth/get-logged-in-user';

async function getServerSideProps(ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext) {
  const user = await getLoggedInUser(ctx);

  return {
    props: {
      user,
    },
  };
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `withAuthedUser` middleware to make sure that the API handler is only called when the user is signed in:

```tsx
import { NextApiRequest,NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { withPipe } from '~/core/middleware/with-pipe';
import { withAuthedUser } from '~/core/middleware/with-authed-user';

async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const user = req.firebaseUser;
  // ...
}

export default withPipe(withAuthedUser, handler);
```

The `firebaseUser` property is added to the request object by the `withAuthedUser` middleware. If the user is not signed in, the middleware will return a 401 response.

## Fetching the signed in user from the frontend

The `withAppProps` middleware used in the gated app pages makes sure that the current signed in user is passed from the backend to the frontend.

### Getting the user Session with "useUserSession"

To retrieve the signed in user from the frontend, you can use the `useUserSession` hook:

```tsx
import { useUserSession } from '~/core/hooks/use-user-session';

const userSession = useUserSession();
```

The `userSession` objects contains the following properties:

```ts
interface UserSession {
  auth: AuthUser | undefined;
  data: UserData | undefined;
}
```

1. **Auth State**: The `auth` property contains the user's authentication data, such as the user ID, email, and so on.
2. **Firestore Data**:  The `data` property contains the user's Firestore record. By default, we do not add any data to the user's Firestore record - but it's assumed you will allow users to store additional data in their Firestore record.

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.

### Getting the user ID with "useUserId"

To retrieve the signed in user ID from the frontend, you can use the `useUserId` hook:

```tsx
import { useUserId } from '~/core/hooks/use-user-id';

const userId = useUserId();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.

### Getting the user role within the organization with "useUserRole"

To retrieve the signed in user role of the current organization from the frontend, you can use the `useUserRole` hook:

```tsx
import { useUserRole } from '~/core/hooks/use-user-role';

const role = useUserRole();
```

This is a React hook and can only be used inside a React component.
