To detect the currently selected locale from the client or the server, you can use the `useTranslation` hook from `next-i18next`.

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from 'next-i18next';

function Component() {
  const { i18n } = useTranslation();
  const { language } = i18n;

  // use language here
}
```
