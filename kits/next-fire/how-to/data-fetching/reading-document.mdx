There is an important distinction to be made when using the Firebase SDK. Indeed, the SDK can be used in two different ways:

1. **Client SDK** - On the client, with minimal permissions (using the Firebase Security Rules), that allows clients to read and write data directly to the database only if they have the right permissions.
2. **Admin SDK** - On the server, with full permissions, that allows the server to read and write data directly to the database without any restriction.

Depending on the use case, you will need to use one or the other.

## Reading a Document with the Client SDK

The client SDK uses Reactfire to make it easier to fetch data directly from React components using React Hooks.

### Reading a Document with "useFirestoreDocData"

To read a single document, we can use the React Hook `useFirestoreDocData` from Reactfire. This hook takes a `DocumentReference` as a parameter and returns the data of the document as well as the status of the request.

In the example below, we fetch the data of a user document from the Firestore database. We can do so because we have the right permissions to read this document and the User ID is available in the React Context.

```tsx
import { doc, DocumentReference } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { useFirestore, useFirestoreDocData } from 'reactfire';
import { UserData } from '~/core/session/types/user-data';
import { useUserId } from '~/core/hooks/use-user-id';
import { USERS_COLLECTION } from '~/lib/firestore-collections';

function useFetchUser() {
  const firestore = useFirestore();
  const userId = useUserId() as string;

  const ref = doc(
    firestore,
    USERS_COLLECTION,
    userId
  ) as DocumentReference<UserData>;

  return useFirestoreDocData(ref, { idField: 'id' });
}

export default useFetchUser;
```

### Breaking Down the Code

Let's break down the code above to understand what is happening.

#### 1. Importing the Reactfire Hooks

First, we import the Reactfire Hooks that we need to fetch the data from the Firestore database.

```tsx
import { doc, DocumentReference } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { useFirestore, useFirestoreDocData } from 'reactfire';
```

#### 2. Importing the User ID

We also import the User ID from the React Context. This is the ID of the user that is currently logged in.

```tsx
import { useUserId } from '~/core/hooks/use-user-id';
```

#### 3. Creating a Document Reference

We create a `DocumentReference` to the user document in the Firestore database. We use the `useFirestore` hook to get access to the Firestore instance.

```tsx
const firestore = useFirestore();
const userId = useUserId() as string;

const ref = doc(
  firestore,
  USERS_COLLECTION,
  userId
) as DocumentReference<UserData>;
```

The `USERS_COLLECTION` is a constant that contains the name of the collection in the Firestore database where the user documents are stored.

This would be `users` in Makerkit.

#### 4. Fetching the Data

Finally, we use the `useFirestoreDocData` hook to fetch the data of the user document. We pass the `DocumentReference` as a parameter and we specify the name of the field that contains the ID of the document.

```tsx
return useFirestoreDocData(ref, { idField: 'id' });
```

### Reading a Document with "useFirestore"

Let's now see how we can read a document using the `useFirestore` hook from Reactfire from within a React component.

The `useFirestoreDocData` hook will return three values:
- `data` - The data of the document.
- `status` - The status of the request

We can use these values to display the data of the document in the React component in a reactive way.

```tsx
function UserComponent() {
  const { data, status } = useFetchUser();

  if (status === 'loading') {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (status === 'error') {
    return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{data.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Reading a document using the Firebase Admin SDK

While the API is similar, the Admin SDK is used in a different way. Indeed, the Admin SDK is used on the server, not on the client. This means that we can't use Reactfire to fetch data from the Firestore database.

The Admin SDK is used only in two cases:
1. When using an API Route
2. When using `getServerSideProps`

**Remember: The Admin SDK is not used in React components**. Similarly, the Web SDK is not used in API Routes or `getServerSideProps`.

### Reading the user from an API Route

Let's see how we can read a user document from an API Route.

Assuming we have a query parameter `userId` in the API Route, we can use the following code to read the user document from the Firestore database.

```ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { withAdmin as withFirebaseAdmin } from '~/core/middleware/with-admin';
import getRestFirestore from '~/core/firebase/admin/get-rest-firestore';

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  await withFirebaseAdmin();

  const { userId } = req.query;
  const firestore = getRestFirestore();
  const usersCollection = firestore.collection('users');
  const user = await usersCollection.doc(userId).get();

  res.status(200).json(user);
}
```

Let's break down the code above to understand what is happening.

#### 1. Importing the Firebase Admin SDK

First, we import the Firebase Admin SDK.

```ts
import { withAdmin as withFirebaseAdmin } from '~/core/middleware/with-admin';
import getRestFirestore from '~/core/firebase/admin/get-rest-firestore';
```

The function `getRestFirestore` returns a Firebase Admin Firestore instance that uses `REST` instead of `gRPC`, because it's much faster in a serverless environment.

#### 2. Using the Firebase Admin SDK

We then use the Firebase Admin SDK to read the user document from the Firestore database.

```ts
await withFirebaseAdmin();

const { userId } = req.query;

const firestore = getRestFirestore();
const usersCollection = firestore.collection('users');
const user = await usersCollection.doc(userId).get();
```

We use the `withFirebaseAdmin` middleware to initialize the Firebase Admin SDK. This middleware must be called before using the Firebase Admin SDK.

We then use the `getRestFirestore` function to get a Firestore instance that uses `REST` instead of `gRPC`.

Finally, we use the Firestore instance to read the user document from the Firestore database.

#### 3. Returning the Data

Finally, we return the data of the user document as JSON.

```ts
res.status(200).json(user);
```
