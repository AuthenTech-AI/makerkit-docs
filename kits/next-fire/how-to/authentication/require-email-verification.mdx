By default, Firebase does not enforce email verification. However, we added support for this feature in the Firebase kit by using server-side checks.

### Can I require email verification for my users using the Firebase kit?

**Yes** - you can.

If you decide to enable this functionality, we will check server-side if the user has verified their email address before allowing them to view the protected pages.

To enable this functionality, you need to set the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` to `true` in your `.env` file.

```tsx
NEXT_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true
```

Feel free to add this variable to the chosen environment file (`.env.development`, `.env.production`, etc) or to the `.env` file if you want to enable it for all environments.
