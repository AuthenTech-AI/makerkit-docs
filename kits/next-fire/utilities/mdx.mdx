MDX is one of the most common Markdown flavours for React-based websites. It
allows us to include our own components into our documents and take out
blog's interactivity to the next level.

The Makerkit starter uses MDX for writing documents in the blog and in the
documentation; it may be likely that you would want to add your own document
types and use MDX for other purposes; for example, you could replace some of
your HTML with MDX documents if you felt like for making it easier to change
by non-technical teammates.

In this section, we will explain how to compile MDX content with the
Makerkit's utilities.

## 1) Compiling MDX to JS

The first step is to compile MDX to Javascript.

To do so, compile your MDX files with the following utility:

```tsx
import { compileMdx } from '~/core/generic';

// MDX string
const content = '';

// JS representation of your MDX content
const compiled = compileMdx(content);
```

## 2) Pass the compiled MDX file into the MDXRenderer component

Finally, we import the `MDXRenderer` component that takes the string
compiled with the `compileMDX` utility and renders it as `HTML`.

```tsx
import MDXRenderer from '~/components/blog/MDXRenderer';

function ArticleBody(props: React.PropsWithChildren<{ content: string }>) {
  return (
    <div>
      <MDXRenderer code={content} />;
    </div>
  );
}
```

Under the hood, the component `MDXRenderer` will inject a couple of
custom components we use in the documents: these can be viewed and
edited at `~/components/blog/MDXComponents`.

## Custom MDX Components

### NextImage

The `NextImage` component replaces the default `img` HTML tag and adds the
awesome capabilities of the default `Image` component baked in Next.js.

You have 2 ways to use this:
1. Simply use an image tag as you would normally
2. Use `NextImage` as a component, which is better if you have to pass
custom attributes such as `width` and `height`

## ExternalLink

All links are automatically patched with the following attributes:
`target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security and UX reasons.

## Video

To embed videos in your blog and docs, simply use the `Video` component:

```tsx
<Video src={"/path/to/video.mp4"} />
```

### Other UI Components

Additionally, we also imported some components from `~/core/ui` by default
that you can use in any MDX document.
