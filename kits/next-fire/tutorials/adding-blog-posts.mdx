We can add your website's blog posts within the `_posts` folder.

#### Collections

Before writing a blog post, we have to define the post's collection. We use `collections` to organize our blog posts by their category.

For example, your blog could have collections such as changelog,
announcements, tutorials, etc.

MakerKit generates every collection with its page, listing all the articles
associated with it.

To change a collection page, please change the file `src/pages/blog/[collection].ts`.

##### Adding collections

Let's see how we can define a `collection` in Typescript:

```tsx
interface Collection {
  name: string;

  // image
  logo?: string;
  emoji?: string;
}
````

As you can see, the only required property to create a collection is a name. You can also attach an image or a simple emoji for each `collection`.

A collection can be simply the following file:

```json
{
  "name":"Changelog"
}
```

#### Writing a Blog Post
The interface of a blog post is the following:

```tsx
interface Post {
  title: string;
  excerpt: string;

  date: string;
  live: boolean;
  tags?: string[];

  coverImage?: string;

  ogImage?: {
    url: string;
  };

  author?: {
    name: string;
    picture: string;
    url: string;
  };

  canonical?: string;
}
```

These values can be defined in MDX files using the `frontmatter`, for example:

```yaml
---
title: An Awesome Post title
except: "Write here a short description for your blog post"
collection: changelog.json
date: '2022-01-05'
live: true
coverImage: '/assets/images/posts/announcement.webp'
tags:
  - changelog
---
```
